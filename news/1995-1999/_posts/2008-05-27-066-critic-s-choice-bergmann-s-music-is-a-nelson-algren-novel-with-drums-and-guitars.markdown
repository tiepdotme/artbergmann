<br />
Lou Reed has said his albums are intended to take rock music into the world of grownups, working the same themes as Hubert Selby and Raymond Carver.<br />
<br />
In that context Art Bergmann's music is a Nelson Algren novel with drums and guitars, and the Vancouver singer/guitarist will be playing his latest chapters tonight at the Gastown Music Hall. Tickets at the door.<br />
<br />
Those who saw Bergmann's performance at the Commodore show a month ago, filmed for the new Bruce McDonald movie, Hard Core Logo, heard a reinvigorated Bergmann at ease enough to perform his punk-era hit, Hawaii, unheard on stage since 1981.<br />
