Lou Reed has said his albums are intended to take rock music into the world of grownups, working the same themes as Hubert Selby and Raymond Carver.  
  
In that context Art Bergmann's music is a Nelson Algren novel with drums and guitars, and the Vancouver singer/guitarist will be playing his latest chapters tonight at the Gastown Music Hall. Tickets at the door.  
  
Those who saw Bergmann's performance at the Commodore show a month ago, filmed for the new Bruce McDonald movie, Hard Core Logo, heard a reinvigorated Bergmann at ease enough to perform his punk-era hit, Hawaii, unheard on stage since 1981.
