<span style="color: #c0c0c0">The Vancouver Sun / Monday, July 27, 1987 / by John Mackie<br /><br />Well well well. Art Bergmann finally seems to be getting the record company attention he deserves. Manager Sam Feldman reports Art's latest demo tape has piqued interest in a whole slew of labels - Polygram, Capitol, Enigma, CBS and Duke Street - with the bulk of the interested parties from the New York and Los Angeles wings of said companies.<br /><br />Feldman &quot;doesn't think there will be a problem&quot; getting a contract with a label - a couple are in the process of drawing up contracts - and that he's looking for a deal where the label will go &quot;the long route&quot; with everyone's favorite local underground sensation.<br /></span>
