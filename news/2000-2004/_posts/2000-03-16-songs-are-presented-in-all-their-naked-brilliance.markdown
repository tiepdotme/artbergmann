Design Flaw (Other Peoples Music-EMI)  
  
Rating: 3.5 out of four stars  
  
Canadian singer-songwriter Art Bergmann's 1998 acoustic gem, Design Flaw, may be a little easier to find in stores the second time around since it's being distributed through EMI Music. No one dives into the quagmire of sin, drugs, death and desire with such poetic passion as this Vancouver-bred rocker and on this disc, armed only with an acoustic guitar and occasional help from legendary guitarist Chris Spedding, Art's songs are presented in all their naked brilliance. This puts faces and feelings to the individuals who swim upstream against society's mainstream values. Still a cult figure "in the garage'' after more than two decades, Bergmann is the Canadian Ray Davies of the dispossessed.
