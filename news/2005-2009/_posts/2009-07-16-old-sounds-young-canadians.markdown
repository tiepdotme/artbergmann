"Let's go to fucking Hawaii / Get drunk in the sun / I want to lay on Waikiki / Get a tan on my buns / Running from the rain / Thousands on the run / Making like they're rich / Heading for the fun."  
  
So shouts the Young Canadians' singer/guitarist Art Bergmann on the band's debut EP, 1980's Hawaii. It wasn't the first appearance on vinyl for the trio&mdash;rounded out by bassist Jim Bescott and drummer Barry Taylor, the band first recorded as the K-Tels, contributing "I Hate Music" to the 1979 compilation Vancouver Complication&mdash;but it was the debut as the Young Canadians, and it found the three punks dropping the gloves right from the opening notes.  
  
It's the initial surf-guitar riff of the title track that sets the tone for the EP; "Hawaii" is far removed from the California beach culture that so many groups sprung from. Initially one might be forgiven for thinking that the Young Canadians mean well, but can't quite hit those clean and happy notes that the band's southern cousins had a decade and a half earlier. But the truth is that, springing forth from the cold and wet world of Vancouver, this band wasn't looking to escape into some dream world of beach parties and good times.  
  
As soon as Bergmann lets loose with that initial "Let's go to fucking Hawaii," the record spins into an entirely new direction. No longer does it seem like it might be an innocent, well-meaning throwback as it assumes the opposite approach, quickly snowballing into a scathing assessment of a culture's focus on getting away, tossing away cash that might be better spent in places closer to home.  
  
Next up, "Well, Well, Well" continues the band's scathing assault on society: "I don't care / I'm just in training for a manager's shift / in the central interior." There's a grind to daily life and the Young Canadians swing at it, juxtaposing the banalities of life with the cuts of punk-rock guitar, bass and drums. It's an effective illustration of just what the young punks of 1980 were up against.  
  
Where the lyrics are perfectly balanced against the music in the first two tracks, on "Hullabaloo Girls" the music takes the lead, the Young Canadians getting into a rock-solid groove, with the vocals matching it step for step as the energy builds. It's not that the lyrics are a disappointment so much as that they simply can't compete with the instruments here.  
  
The EP wraps up with "No Escape," the lyrics once again coming to the fore as the band lays down a tale riddled with oppresiveness&mdash;"They've got the guns and the numbers," Bergmann sings of the police, setting up the eternal battle of the system versus the youth, while the trio shifts between the moody guitar on the intro and the pounding, bass-driven verses.  
  
Initial pressings of Hawaii came with an additional EP, the Young Canadians' first, entitled Automan and recorded in 1979 as the K-Tels but not released until '80. The band would last for one more EP, This Is Your Life, which found the group's style shifting towards new wave and the playing getting tighter and more refined than the crash-and-burn string-slashing the trio blasted through Hawaii's four tracks with. The band's entire catalogue can now be found on the compilation No Escape, available from Sudden Death Records. V
