Musicians scrawled set lists on scrap paper.<br />
<br />
Kids in black leather glued posters to lampposts, or stapled flyers to telephone polls.<br />
<br />
Budding entrepreneurs who were as much fans as businessmen released vinyl records on obscure labels in limited pressings.<br />
<br />
The Vancouver punk scene of the late 1970s had a do-it-your-@%&amp;*#!-self ethos. The musicians adopted (itx)noms de punk(enditx) &mdash; Wimpy, Dimwit, Rampage, Useless, Jughead, Shithead. Bands formed and disbanded and reformed, sometime before ever performing. They called themselves D.O.A., Dishrags, Subhumans, K-tels, Moral Lepers, and they Rocked Against This and they Rocked For That.<br />
<br />
Gigs were doused in blood, sweat and gob.<br />
<br />
An exhilarating scene faded away just as mysteriously as it had first appeared. Over time, some of the musicians succumbed to 9-to-5 wage slavery. Others surrendered to addictions. A handful continued to make music in their own fashion.<br />
<br />
Thirty years later, the W.A.C. Bennett Library at Simon Fraser University has launched what is believed to be the first institutional archive of punk material in Canada.<br />
<br />
The library is seeking donations for the use of generations of scholars to come.<br />
<br />
Perhaps some future doctoral thesis will explore the common themes to be found in such Vancouver punk anthems as D.O.A.&rsquo;s &ldquo;Disco Sucks&rdquo; and the Subhumans&rsquo; &ldquo;Fuck You.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been fun building this collection,&rdquo; said Eric Swanick, the head of special collections. His own musical tastes are such that he describes himself as &ldquo;just an old rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roller.&rdquo; The former New Brunswick Legislative Librarian was unfamiliar with D.O.A.&rsquo;s oeuvre, but happily has a 15-year-old son who is an aficionado of headbanging hardcore.<br />
<br />
The librarian has since attended a show by the Pointed Sticks (his verdict: &ldquo;Not so punkish&rdquo;) and continues to seek leads on other material. Punk&rsquo;s ephemeral nature offers special difficulties for the archive. Posters were printed on the cheapest paper possible. Much else was temporary and disposable.<br />
<br />
He struck a motherlode last year. John Armstrong, the writer who founded the Modernettes as Buck Cherry, a name he has since licensed to an American band, turns out to have been a punk packrat.<br />
<br />
Mr. Armstrong collected comic books as a boy and, when he joined friend Art Bergmann in the nascent music scene of the late 1970s, he brought to it an acquisitiveness and a sense of history.<br />
<br />
He kept flyers, set lists, gig posters, photographs, magazine articles, newspaper clippings, backstage passes, and handwritten lyric sheets.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I started with a plastic Safeway bag,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then it was two bags. Then three. Then a box. The box turned into a suitcase bought at Value Village.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I just hung onto stuff and it grew and grew and grew.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
He schlepped the suitcase even as he moved umpteen times. When the hinges finally broke from trying to restrain the growing pile, he dropped $15 on a large, travelling wardrobe at a second-hand store.<br />
<br />
When the librarian heard about the wardrobe, he asked for an invitation to Mr. Armstrong&rsquo;s downtown eastside residence.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;We sat down in my living room. We opened it up and started going through things. Making piles. He played it pretty cool. He&rsquo;d pick something up and go, &lsquo;Umm-hmm.&rsquo; &rdquo;<br />
<br />
Mr. Armstrong has written two brilliant and funny memoirs in &ldquo;Wages&rdquo; (his working life) and &ldquo;Guilty of Everything&rdquo; (his so-called musical career) for New Star Books. He was eager to let go of the material.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Please take this away. I hung onto all this stuff. I did my duty. I&rsquo;m sick of having it around.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
The librarian even took the wardrobe itself.<br />
<br />
Some punk material is on display at special collections on the library&rsquo;s seventh floor on the Burnaby campus, as are other items donated last year.<br />
<br />
These include a book with an original Marc Chagall lithograph; a hymnal published in the Carrier language in 1901; a bound volume of the satirical journal Karagoz (Blackeye), published in Istanbul at the end of the Ottoman Empire; and, several works by William Cobbett, the popular English journalist and pamphleteer who championed rural peoples during the Industrial Revolution.<br />
<br />
The novelist Eden Robinson donated her papers, making her the latest addition to the library&rsquo;s roster of British Columbia writers, which includes Shani Mootoo, Bill Gaston and Michael Turner.<br />
<br />
The library is the repository for the papers of the Little Sisters Bookstore in its long-running legal battle to import material for its gay and lesbian clientele. The Canadian Farmworkers Union has also placed its papers with the institution.<br />
<br />
The editorial cartoonist John Larter, who was nominated last week for a National Newspaper Award last week, donated 1,185 works. Another 800 cartoons were added to the collection by Bob Bierman, Graham Harrop and Bob Krieger.<br />
<br />
The library maintains a searchable database of 5,000 scanned toons. As it turns out, the W.A.C. Bennett Library holds 65 editorial cartoons poking fun at the foibles of its namesake.<br />
<br />
Next year, the library and the English department hope to host an international punk conference for academics at the university&rsquo;s downtown campus, which is only a short stagger down the road from the old Smilin&rsquo; Buddha Cabaret, scene of many a punk bacchanalia.<br />
<br />
As it turns out, the library offers donators money or an official receipt to be filed with Revenue Canada. For Mr. Armstrong, the call was easy, &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be very punk to take a tax break,&rdquo; he said. He took the money. Unlike so many of his shows back in the day, his gig as amateur archivist ended with a payday.<br />
