<br />
1. HAWAII<br />
<br />
The Young Canadians' biggest hit, with an incredibly infectious guitar line and chorus that simultaneously mocks and celebrates taking a mid-winter holiday in the sun. Makes prominent use of the 'f' word.<br />
<br />
The chorus was a favourite saying of Ross Carpenter, a Bergmann friend and musician from White Rock, B.C., who claims he wrote much of the song. Bergmann says he can't remember Carpenter playing him Hawaii, but acknowledged Carpenter by belatedly giving him a co-writing credit on the Young Canadians' No Escape CD when it was released.<br />
<br />
2. DATA REDUX<br />
<br />
Anti-war rocker with one of Bergmann's best guitar solos and fabulous production by Bob Rock.<br />
<br />
On No Escape.<br />
<br />
3. DON'T BOTHER ME<br />
<br />
A brilliant pop song about being dumped.<br />
<br />
On No Escape.<br />
<br />
4. MY EMPTY HOUSE<br />
<br />
Savage rocker about a man who gets laid off, goes nuts and shoots his wife. Inspired by a rash of murder-suicides that hit B.C.'s Lower Mainland in the early 1980s in the wake of the Social Credit government's restraint program.<br />
<br />
It was recorded several times, but the best version is on the Poisoned cassette produced by Paul Hyde and mixed by Bob Rock.<br />
<br />
It may be reissued on a CD Ray Fulber is working on, with the working title The Lost Art of Bergmann.<br />
<br />
5. INSIDE YOUR LOVE<br />
<br />
Scorcher from the John Cale-produced Crawl With Me album on Duke Street, with an incredible guitar solo.<br />
<br />
Available as a download on iTunes. There is also apparently a Bob Rock version that's even better, which may or may not be on The Lost Art of Bergmann.<br />
<br />
6. THE HOSPITAL SONG<br />
<br />
Lovely pop song about an OD, with the immortal line &quot;maybe later we'll get together and have a relapse.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the Sexual Roulette album on Duke Street, also on iTunes.<br />
<br />
7. DIRGE<br />
<br />
Psychotic Led Zeppelin-esque number about a cocaine fiend threatening to go on a murder rampage.<br />
<br />
On Sexual Roulette, iTunes.<br />
<br />
8. GAMBOL<br />
<br />
One of Art's wildest rockers, with a great lyric about living on the edge.<br />
<br />
On Sexual Roulette, iTunes.<br />
<br />
9. FAITHLESSLY YOURS<br />
<br />
Art's radio hit, with a wonderful descending melody line.<br />
<br />
On the Polygram album Art Bergmann, which is currently out of print.<br />
<br />
10. REMEMBER HER NAME<br />
<br />
Powerful, slow-burning number about a sordid affair by a woman who looks like Marianne Faithfull.<br />
<br />
On Art Bergmann, currently out of print.<br />
<br />
