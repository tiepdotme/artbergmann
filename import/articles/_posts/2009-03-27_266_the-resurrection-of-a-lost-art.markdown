<span class="Apple-style-span"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999">Globe and Mail / February 18, 2009 / by Tom Hawthorn</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #c0c0c0"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">The demo tapes were going to take Art Bergmann to the big time.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
The Vancouver singer was a lean and angry performer with a ferocious
presence. He wrote razor-sharp lyrics about life's underbelly, singing
tales of molestation and desperation in a voice as sordid as his gutter
topics.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
Any schmo can write a love song. Mr. Bergmann preferred exploring the motives of a guy who guns down his family.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
No &ldquo;moon-June&rdquo; rhyming for him. His stuff was smart.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
In the mid-1980s he recorded some songs in Vancouver with an
up-and-coming producer. The demo tapes led to a contract with a Toronto
label. They had the songs produced by John Cale, who founded the Velvet
Underground with Lou Reed. Mr. Cale eschewed the loud rhythm guitars
that had been so much of the Bergmann sound. It was OK, but it wasn't
really Art.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
Mr. Bergmann later had a Juno nomination, got signed and dumped by
another major label, continued to write songs of genius, kicked a
debilitating drug habit (the experience of which was captured in the
album title, What Fresh Hell Is This?), and, finally, settled down on a
farm in Southern Alberta, where he lives a spartan life as a
semi-recluse.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
The big time never happened.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
Over the years, the original demo tapes took on a semi-mythological status.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
If only John Cale had appreciated guitars, if only the tapes'
up-and-coming producer had been employed on the record, if only Art had
not been torn by his allegiance to his art and his uneasiness with the
business, then maybe Mr. Bergmann's music might have found the wide
audience it deserved.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
Now, 20 years later, the demo tapes are being released.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
Bearwood Music is releasing a compact disc next month titled Lost Art Bergmann.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
The independent label is owned by Ray Fulber and Susann Richter, a
husband-and-wife team who played bass and keyboards on the demos and in
Bergmann's band, Poisoned.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
&ldquo;I think Art is a Canadian&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">iconoclast</span><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">,&rdquo; Mr. Fulber said. &ldquo;He's written some brilliant songs that stand at any level.&rdquo;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
The couple toured with Mr. Bergmann for about five years. They now live
in Gibsons on the Sunshine Coast, where they operate a recording studio
from their small acreage overlooking Georgia Strait.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
The tapes spent decades in a box happily not lost despite some wild
times. He hung on to the tapes in part because he considered them his
&ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; to the music industry.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
The passing years caused the tapes to become unplayable. The solution?
A slow baking at 135 degrees Fahrenheit in a Snackmaster food
dehydrator. Cook for six hours, turn every 30 minutes.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
The tapes were mixed by Bob Rock, who had been passed over as producer
in favour of John Cale. The irony is that Mr. Rock, which is,
incidentally, his real family name, went on to become one of rock's
great hit-makers, handling recordings by Aerosmith, Metallica, and
Motley Crue.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
Three of the songs on Lost Art Bergmann were produced by Paul Hyde, Mr. Rock's partner in the Payola$.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
&ldquo;It's radio-friendly and then you listen to the lyrics and it's heavy,&rdquo; Mr. Fulber said.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
He knows life offers twists and surprises and ironies that are only
funny with the passage of time. Take his father, Fred, a social
democrat in Germany at the time of Hitler's rise. He was working as a
merchant mariner when he jumped ship at Fanny Bay on Vancouver Island.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
It was 1938. He lurked around isolated logging camps, picking up work as a cook as he tried to teach himself English.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
After Canada went to war with Germany, though, he was picked up by the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police as an enemy alien. He likely spent time
in a prison camp with other Germans, some of whom would have been the
very Nazis from whom he was fleeing.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
Nazi atrocities figure on more than one Bergmann song, as the
songwriter contemplates the horror and his own heritage. He was born to
a devoted Mennonite family in the Vancouver suburbs. Some of his
earliest drug experiences came while hanging out with the juvenile
delinquents sent to live with his family.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
He joined the Mount Lehman Grease Band, which gained an avid following
in the Abbotsford area. One of his bandmates was David Mitchell, who
later chose politics over punk. He wrote a favourable biography of
Social Credit premier W.A.C. Bennett before being elected an MLA
himself. Mr. Mitchell recently became president of the Public Policy
Forum and is a frequent contributor to The Globe and Mail's op-ed page.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
Mr. Bergmann followed a different path. He played in a band called the
Schmorgs before joining the K-Tels, for whom he co-wrote Hawaii, a
blistering and ribald paean to every Canadian's desire to escape
winter. The song, an instant punk classic, got no airplay because of
the frequent adjectival use of a common expletive.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
(The K-Tels got a lawyer's letter ordering them to desist using the
good name of the Winnipeg-based company known for its household gadgets
and its &ldquo;Sound Explosion!&rdquo; compilation albums. They briefly renamed
themselves the X-Tels before settling on Young Canadians, a deceptively
squeaky-clean moniker.)</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
Then came the punk superband, Los Popularos, and then came Poisoned and then came disappointment.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
Mr. Bergmann will play his first Vancouver date in many years. He
suffers from arthritis, making guitar-playing difficult, and had an
operation last fall on his back.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
On March 26, he will join his old bandmates from Poisoned on stage as
part of a CD release concert. It is being held during a week of Juno
festivities leading to the music awards show three days later.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #999999"><span style="font-size: 1em">
&ldquo;It's going to be a spectacle,&rdquo; Mr. Fulber promises.</span></span></span></span>
