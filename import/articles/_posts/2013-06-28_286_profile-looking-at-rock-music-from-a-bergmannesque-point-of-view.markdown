Vancouver Sun / Feburary 14, 1995 / Katherine Monk (Sun Pop Music Critic)<br />
<br />
Art Bergmann feels a little out of time and place in this designer coffee shop on Davie Street: He'd rather be in Paris, circa 1871--bathing in chaos, feasting on the ashes of revolution and wars lost.<br />
<br />
But he wasn't so lucky.<br />
<br />
He was born a little over 40 years ago in the benign, fertile flatlands of the Fraser Valley.<br />
<br />
Whatever chaos Vancouver's own rock 'n' roll legend has managed to find, he's created himself.<br />
<br />
His career is a giant splatter of brilliance, bad deals, substance abuse and debt. He's been accused time and time again of sabotaging his own success with vitriolic relationships with the music industry, abusive remarks to his own record labels, and a general laissez-faire apporoach to the whole notion of &quot;professionalism.&quot;<br />
<br />
At a recent show in Calgary geared at showcasing Bergmann's latest project, What Fresh Hell is This?, to eager record label representatives and industry VIPs before its release today, Bergmann decided to hurl abuse at the spectators.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the f--- are you losers doing here watching me die?&quot; he was quoted as saying before the drummer left the stage, the beer bottles started to fly and one Calgary radio programmer was kicked out of the bar by Bergmann's band.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like all great bands we fell apart. I like to push it right to the edge and then piss over it,&quot; he says in his soft, gentle voice. &quot;That was a case of pushing it to the edge and falling over.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not like Bergmann isn't aware of his own reflection. He sees himself, for the most part, a little too clearly.<br />
<br />
In the past, he just smashed the mirror.<br />
<br />
But now, after 20 years of standing on &quot;the gleaming junk heap of modern culture and making art through rock 'n' roll,&quot; Bergmann is looking for a new form of freedom: the freedom of paying the rent, eating regularly and having enough money to travel.<br />
<br />
Recently signed to Sony--his third record label--after collaborating on a Neil Young tribute last summer, Bergmann knows that he may be looking at his last chance at permanent financial security.<br />
<br />
And there seems to have been a critical shift.<br />
<br />
He trust his new manager. He's off junk. He's accessible. &quot;I'm doing everything they're asking me to do,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
For once, Art is playing the game--or at least, his own prvate version of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;They don't understand anything I say half the time. A million references coming in and out--I feel like Lenny Bruce. My jokes go right over their heads,&quot; he says with a flying hand in the air, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, the songs aren't mine anymore--they are product. All creation is eventually turned into product and sold back to the youth culture.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just need people to react. I need people to participate. We had two shows in Toronto that were just insane...glass was raining down on the audience. It was total chaos. It was beautiful. They were shouting, &quot;We're bleeding for you Art, we're bleeding for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty cool,&quot; he says, gently taking another drag on his cigarette.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the swirling vortex and I have to stand there in the middle of it, surfing on the razor's edge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dangerous--but only to himself.<br />
<br />
It's not surprise, then, that Bergmann has considered taking the grand exit, like so many other creative souls before him.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, when the &quot;mind-chatter&quot; keeps you up at night (he's an insomniac) and the current state of the social order is enough to instill incendiary thought--it can seem like the only way to find peace.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I didn't want to leave a mess for someone else to clean up. I don't like the idea of hurting people that way. You're fine--it's the people you leave behind who aren't.&quot;<br />
<br />
In other words, Bergmann believes in love. Married for the last four years, Bergmann said he got married for all the right reasons: love and sharing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like the warm glow of the sun as much as the next person. I've seen Hell and it's a cold, cold place.&quot;<br />
