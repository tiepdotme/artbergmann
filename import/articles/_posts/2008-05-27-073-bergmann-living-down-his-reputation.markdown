Canadian rock legend tries a mellower sound<br />
<br />
Knock around any business long enough and you'll be rewarded with a Reputation.<br />
<br />
Such is the honour of Art Bergmann, who - after something like 35 years in the rock 'n' roll maelstrom - is definitely in the running for CanRock iconhood, albeit on a modest scale.<br />
<br />
And that Reputation precedes him: One of those punk-before-there-was-punk guys. Surly. Unpredictable. Record-label nightmare. Drugs. Bit of a nutter, really. Etcetera.<br />
<br />
This blinding autumn afternoon, though, Bergmann - perched, smoking and slightly flu-ridden, on a stamp-sized College St. patio - is not the miasma of rock legends I'd been led to expect. Just a perfectly likable, if slightly rumpled and curmudgeonly, middle-aged (&quot;I'm 400,&quot; he says) musician.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's amazing. People make up stories and badmouth me,&quot; says Bergmann, mumbling into his coffee. &quot;I've never missed a show, I don't think.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a consummate professional.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smirk. But seriously, he adds, he'd prefer to cede his walking-disaster title to someone who can pull it off with a little more enthusiasm than he's willing to muster these days.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like to sit back and watch the younger guys now,&quot; he says, &quot;See if they can pull it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bergmann - who's been grinding out snarling, hard-edged rock songs since he began his career during the early '70s with Vancouver bands like the K-Tels and The Young Canadians - should buck a few more expectations with the release this week of his new album, Design Flaw.<br />
<br />
A collection of songs he's penned over the past decade (plus a cover of Gram Parsons' &quot;Sin City&quot;), it was recorded acoustically in Toronto producer Peter Moore's kitchen last year, with guitarist Chris Spedding dropping a few electric textures into the mix.<br />
<br />
The record gets a proper unveiling tonight when Bergmann performs with Spedding at Rancho Relaxo (300 College St.).<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a little dreary,&quot; Bergmann says of the album. &quot;It's 4 a.m. music.&quot;<br />
<br />
Design Flaw's unplugged approach grew out of the sporadic acoustic sets Bergmann performed over the past couple years, during an extended sabbatical from the music business.<br />
<br />
Although he's never really enjoyed a long and fruitful relationship with any record label, Bergmann hit the wall when Sony Canada dumped him after 1995's acclaimed What Fresh Hell Is This? - especially since the disc snared a Juno for best alternative album.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just decided to quit everything for a while, quit the business for a while,&quot; recalls Bergmann, who was eventually lured to Ontario from Vancouver to play some low-overhead acoustic dates.<br />
<br />
He never left.<br />
<br />
&quot;I came out here for a couple of shows and had no reason to go back,&quot; he says. &quot;So I said to my wife: 'You feel like being Gypsies for a while?' &quot;<br />
<br />
At one point, someone suggested Bergmann record one of his solo shows, and the seed was planted for Design Flaw. The album - which is being released on punk-reissue label Other People's Music - contains older material, in part because he wanted to do a career overview. But Bergmann's distaste for the music industry had effectively sapped him of the desire to compose any new songs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm starting to write now, thank God,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought it was gone - I killed a couple of Muses for a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;The whole destructive lifestyle was best for me. My best stuff came from a hangover.&quot;<br />
<br />
The acoustic-troubadour thing is temporary, says Bergmann, who pledges to return to full, caustic, noisy form once he scrapes up enough cash to bring his band back to Toronto.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going out west right away,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm going to meet up with a couple of members of my band and play a few shows - get really loud for a couple of weeks. Then hopefully I can afford to get the guys out here.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll see if I can prance around like a fucking gigolo, like Steven Tyler. God, I hate that shit. Go away.&quot;<br />
