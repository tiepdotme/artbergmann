<span style="color: #c0c0c0">The Vancouver Sun / Saturday, April 14, 1990 / by John Mackie<br /><br />ART BERGMANN <br /><br />Sexual Roulette (Duke Street)<br /><br />4 out of four stars<br /><br />Now, this is more like it. Art turns up the grunge on his second platter for Duke Street, howling like a wild beast and scorching on the gee-tar.<br /><br />Lyrically, he's down in the gutter again, detailing the sordid affairs of murderous junkies, sexual deviates and general on-(or over)-the-edge lunatics.<br /><br />The Zeppelinesque Dirge # 1 is truly disturbing, while the Hospital Song will have one and all singing along to the irresistably poppy chorus, &quot;maybe later, we'll get together and have a relapse.&quot;<br /><br />And there are several more killers to choose from, including the hard-hitting Gambol, the lovely (and warped) ballad Sleep, and the rollicking Bound For Vegas. Exceptional.<br /></span>
