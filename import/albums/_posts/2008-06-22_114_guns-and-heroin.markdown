Some people never go out<br />
I understand why<br />
Need something to read about<br />
The space in their eyes<br />
<br />
Others we just can't stay in<br />
No romance no matter how stricken<br />
Though poverty is not what it seems<br />
I can't fathom fear<br />
<br />
So if I seem close to danger<br />
What does the bible say<br />
Nothing will ever change<br />
Safe in our beds<br />
Like the rich in their tombs<br />

<br />
Where did the money come from<br />
Two weeks out of prison<br />
Fifty dollars for a gun<br />
Turned into fifty thousand<br />
<br />
We met two mutual friends<br />
She's a hooker I'm a musician<br />
He wants legitimate business<br />
God if he only knew it's the same as...<br />

<br />
Tell me what is your reason <br />
for entering our fair state<br />
What is your purpose <br />
of crossing the border here today<br />
What is your business <br />
in this beautiful country<br />
What are your reasons <br />
for entering the USA<br />
