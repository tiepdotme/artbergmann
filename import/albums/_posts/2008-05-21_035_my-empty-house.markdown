<br />
Won't you come home<br />
To my empty house<br />
I'm all alone<br />
Except for<br />
My former spouse<br />
Won't you come home<br />
It's full of empty minds<br />
I've got an empty heart<br />
Can't you hear the whine<br />
<br />
They said<br />
Things would be alright<br />
After a couple of years<br />
Of restraint<br />
But the kids<br />
Aren't getting any younger<br />
And for me<br />
It's much too late<br />
<br />
I got married in a fever<br />
I'd sonner kill you<br />
Than leave you<br />
I'm thinking maybe<br />
We should have moved<br />
Staring at you<br />
Across my living room<br />
<br />
When things go wrong<br />
Turn to the right<br />
When things get worse<br />
Pick up a gun<br />
Things for me<br />
Just got weird<br />
I think I shot<br />
The wrong person<br />
I'm painting<br />
The whole house red<br />
<br />
Everthing I worked for<br />
One by one<br />
Going out my door<br />
Save for my TV<br />
Buzzing in the corner<br />
The house is surrounded<br />
<br />
I can get a job<br />
I can't geed the kids<br />
I can get a job<br />
I can't feed you<br />
If you're as sick of me<br />
As I am of you<br />
Believe me<br />
I feel the same<br />
<br />
Won't you come homje<br />
To my empty house<br />
I've got an empty heart<br />
I've got an empty mind<br />
I went to trade school<br />
Got my welding ticket<br />
Did my time<br />
I've got a 2-car garage<br />
A lein on my mortgage<br />
On my happy 2.2<br />
<br />
I think I'll paint<br />
The whole damn town<br />
Red</span>
