<span style="color: #c0c0c0">(Neil Young)<br />
<br />
People tell us<br />
That we play too loud<br />
But they don't know<br />
What our music's about<br />
We never listen<br />
To the record company man<br />
They try to change us<br />
And ruin our band<br />
<br />
That's why we don't want to be good<br />
That's why we don't want to be good<br />
We're prisoners of rock and roll<br />
<br />
When were jamming<br />
In our old garage<br />
The girls come over<br />
And it sure gets hot<br />
We don't want to be watered down<br />
Taking orders<br />
From record company clowns<br />
<br />
That's why we don't want to be good<br />
That's why we don't want to be good<br />
We're prisoners of rock and roll<br />
<br />
We're prisoners of rock and roll</span><br />
<br />
