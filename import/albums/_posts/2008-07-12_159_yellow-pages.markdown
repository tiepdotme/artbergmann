I used to work with someone<br />
Me and Billy always got the job done<br />
I thought this would last for years<br />
The start of a promising career<br />
All this was ruined at an early age<br />
By distortion on the public page<br />
Cuz I met this guy at a party one night<br />
Don't know what I said<br />
Didn't know he could write<br />
He said &quot;I've got some dirt on you&quot;<br />
All he wanted from me was the facts<br />
The next day I read we were through<br />
You know it said I stuck a knife in your back<br />
<br />
I'll forget what you said<br />
If you forget what I heard<br />
If you forget what you read<br />
I'll remember the word<br />
<br />
I used to go with a girl<br />
We're gonna go around the world<br />
She said love<br />
You know the one<br />
Forever gonna be so much fun<br />
I should have known this could never last<br />
Now she's just a photograph<br />
Cuz I met this chck at a party one night<br />
Don't know what I said<br />
Didn't know she could write<br />
She said &quot;I've got some dirt on you&quot;<br />
All she wanted was the facts<br />
Next day I read we were through<br />
Read that we were through<br />
You know it said I stuck a knife in your back<br />
Sticking knives in our backs<br />
Yellow journalist<br />
When I see you again<br />
We'll act like friends<br />
And carry on<br />
With the social pretense<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
<br />
I want you<br />
But all we see<br />
Are the jaundiced little notes<br />
Of the blind<br />
Can you hear me<br />
Through the din<br />
And hope that nothing's lost in the translation<br />
Every town's got a whore<br />
And think they've got a saint<br />
And if the two should ever meet<br />
Who's gonna lodge the complaint<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
<br />
