<br />
It's a new deal<br />
With the same deck of cards<br />
Any old play<br />
We're fashioning new parts<br />
<br />
I get too nervous<br />
I can't touch you now<br />
I get so excited<br />
But I'll catch you somehow<br />
<br />
Try and make sense<br />
With a pair of loaded dice<br />
Is like having faith<br />
In some guy called Christ<br />
<br />
I get too nervous<br />
I can't touch you now<br />
I get so excited<br />
But I'll catch you somehow<br />
(Catch you somehow)<br />
<br />
Our luck <br />
Has now run its course<br />
All
wagers lost<br />
On a fast dark horse<br />
<br />
I get too nervous<br />
I can't touch you now<br />
I get so excited<br />
But I'll catch you somehow<br />
(Catch you somehow)<br />
<br />
It's a crap shoot<br />
With you as victim<br />
Will you survive<br />
The odds are slim to none<br />
<br />
I get too nervous<br />
I can't touch you now<br />
I get so excited<br />
But I'll catch you somehow<br />
(Catch you somehow)<br />
<br />
When the waiting is over<br />
When the days are through<br />
And I relax with you<br />
We'll fall in love<br />
Yeah, we'll all fall in love<br />
Again<br />
<br />
(Yeah, right)</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0" class="Apple-style-span">
