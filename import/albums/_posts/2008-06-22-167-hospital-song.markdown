Yes I know<br />
What I've done<br />
And I know<br />
That it's wrong<br />
Cuz I talked<br />
To your mom<br />
We watched you<br />
All night long<br />
I put a pillow<br />
Under your head<br />
Laid down some rags<br />
You'd read<br />
Friends sent cards<br />
And flowers<br />
Said they hoped<br />
You got well<br />
<br />
From your hospital bed<br />
To my padded cell<br />
There's not one thing<br />
We need<br />
This is heaven and hell<br />
<br />
Maybe later<br />
We'll get together<br />
Learn how to relax<br />
Maybe later<br />
We'll get together<br />
And have a relapse<br />
<br />
I watch you sleep<br />
In your tubes<br />
And IV's<br />
They kept your face<br />
So clean<br />
Would it seem<br />
Too mean<br />
If I pull the plug<br />
On your dream machine<br />
Would I be<br />
Losing you<br />
Or would we<br />
Meet again<br />
<br />
How I wish<br />
You knew<br />
How to live<br />
How I wish<br />
We'd known<br />
How to live
