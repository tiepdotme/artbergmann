<br />
Start the time<br />
Every morning<br />
In the rain<br />
My life is waiting<br />
Get on the bus<br />
Who could enjoy this<br />
Here on the bus<br />
Who will employ us<br />
I take the pains<br />
To avert my eyes<br />
There&rsquo;s always a psycho<br />
With me in his sights<br />
I wish <br />
For just 5 minutes<br />
He&rsquo;d be on my side<br />
I wish<br />
For just 5 minutes<br />
He&rsquo;d be on my side<br />
Hide behind my paper<br />
An item in the news<br />
Some kid <br />
Got his head blown off<br />
Now he&rsquo;s twenty-one forever<br />
A lucky guy<br />
Twenty-one forever<br />
He stopped the time<br />
Count the clocks<br />
Count the blocks<br />
Count the stops<br />
Until I get off<br />
I wish<br />
For just 5 minutes<br />
Stop the time<br />
