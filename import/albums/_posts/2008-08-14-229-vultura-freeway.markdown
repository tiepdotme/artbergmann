<i>album: Vultura Freeway + Poisoned EP</i><br />
<br />
It's not summer<br />
But it's hot today<br />
This ain't no holiday<br />
Vultura Freeway<br />
<br />
Who could ever understand<br />
What it costs to be in the band<br />
A common knowledge of our fate<br />
Like an agreement between church and state<br />
Friendship lies in unholy ties<br />
No cheap entertainment on this trip<br />
No sideshows out on the strip<br />
Just the wind and gas and whatever drug<br />
That through our bodies rip<br />
I ain't in no business grip<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
<br />
A common bond and what we need<br />
And when it runs out you'll find a friend indeed<br />
When he died it was with a scream<br />
On a roadway strewn with dreams<br />
Blood isn't always what it seems<br />
Ninety miles an hour in a blue tin box<br />
We were still laughing&nbsp; when we hit the rocks<br />
And just within reach of that golden beach<br />
As the waves crashed over us<br />
Discontented dispossessed and desperate<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
<br />
Meanwhile<br />
All along the new gold coast<br />
They raise their glasses in a back-stabbing toast<br />
On their knees to suck on the host<br />
A warm death awaits you<br />
A warm death awaits you<br />
Take my hand and we'll go to hell<br />
Ugly into beautiful<br />
<br />
It's not summer, but it's hot today<br />
This ain't no holiday<br />
The law disappears today<br />
Vultura Freeway<br />
