<span style="color: #c0c0c0">(lyrics: Bergmann, &nbsp;music: Bergmann/Susann Richter)<br /><i>album: Art Bergmann</i><br /><br />January 15, 1991... I feel like gettin' down<br />on my knees and prayin'... I'm walkin' <br />straight to my lover... In the east end <br />they're comin' down... I've made a big <br />decision towards the other. Walking <br />through Japantown... Watching bums <br />steal fruit from sidewalk stands... Without <br />ever getting caught. I'm thinking about<br />what Knowlton Nash said on the National <br />News... About some war correspondent... <br />Talking from the front... The thrill of <br />getting shot at and missed... Me, I'm <br />supposed to be writing a hit.<br /><br />I can't change this world<br />It's too dangerous for all the boys and girls<br /><br />All the creeps and the jerks that pass <br />me and harass me... They think I've got <br />something... Something more... Something <br />to give them... I blame them. I put my <br />ear to the ground and listen fro the sound <br />of falling change... Get out my wallet to <br />look for a transfer to get out of range of <br />people hating people for all weird <br />reasons... Around the world they throw <br />toys like an angry little brother in a <br />sandbox... With the hatred of an unrequited <br />lover... Or an envious kid sister.<br /><br />I can't change this world<br />It's too dangerous for all the boys and girls<br /><br />Sit around all day just waiting for <br />something clever to say... I'm losing my <br />grip on this pen and feel like searching <br />for my syringe again... Makes me hate <br />my own song.<br /><br />I can't change this world<br />It's too dangerous for all the boys and girls<br />I can't change this world<br />It's too dangerous for all the boys and girls<br />I can't change this world</span>
