<br />
Tell me what's the difference<br />
In you and me and what you'd like to see<br />
We all want a better life<br />
No questions of heaven or hell<br />
Answers in black or white<br />
<br />
But I'll be living in another gray area<br />
<br />
Who'll want anyone anymore<br />
We just open our books and close the doors<br />
No one can be innocent <br />
Resigned to it<br />
And born without it<br />
<br />
When we get to the end and we find what we're after<br />
A room filled with friends ringing with peals of laughter<br />
And we spit in the face of any worldwide disaster<br />
But I don't want to be alone tonight<br />
<br />
I'll be living in another gray area<br />
<br />
Call me if you get the chance<br />
Hey what's going on<br />
Do you still dance<br />
<br />
Where you gonna find someone who's innocent<br />
We're all losers here until we win<br />
And when we get to the end and we find what we're after<br />
A room filled with friends ringing with peals of laughter<br />
And we spit in the face of any worldwide disaster<br />
But I don't want to be alone tonight<br />
<br />
I'll be living in another gray area<br />
