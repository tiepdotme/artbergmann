<br />
I saw you at the station<br />
Waving and smiling bye-bye<br />
No, I&rsquo;ve never seen you so happy<br />
With a ticket in your hand<br />
On a train to the east<br />
<br />
No, don&rsquo;t ever let me go<br />
Don&rsquo;t let them make me say<br />
I told you so baby<br />
Baby, baby, don&rsquo;t get in line<br />
Now look who&rsquo;s crying<br />
<br />
I saw you on the platform<br />
Waving and smiling and looking so fine<br />
Your parents are so well informed<br />
You follow suit<br />
The blind leading the blind<br />
<br />
No, don&rsquo;t ever let me go<br />
Don&rsquo;t let them make me say<br />
I told you so baby<br />
Baby, baby, don&rsquo;t get in line<br />
Now look who&rsquo;s crying<br />
That&rsquo;s the whole of the law<br />
Bye-bye<br />
<br />
Your parents gave you orders<br />
Cursed with a birth certificate<br />
A passport and a stamp<br />
You&rsquo;re on a train crossing borders<br />
Machine gun nest <br />
Barbed wire blessed <br />
Holiday camp<br />
<br />
No, don&rsquo;t ever let me go<br />
Don&rsquo;t let them make me say<br />
I told you so baby<br />
Baby, baby, don&rsquo;t get in line<br />
Now look who&rsquo;s crying<br />
That&rsquo;s the whole of the law<br />
Bye-bye <br />
That&rsquo;s the whole of the law<br />
Bye-bye<br />
