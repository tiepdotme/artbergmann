<br />
I was lying on the table<br />
Prone and oblivious<br />
You were staring at me<br />
Intentions obvious<br />
I thought I might be able<br />
To make something<br />
Out of this<br />
We shook hands<br />
Later we'd kiss<br />
You asked where<br />
We were going<br />
I said that depends<br />
If we fall in love<br />
It will be your living end<br />
<br />
Everybody wants<br />
What they can't have<br />
You could have me<br />
But you won't keep<br />
Opportunity knocks<br />
Only once<br />
I said get lost<br />
Now here's your chance<br />
<br />
Crawl with me<br />
Crawl with me home<br />
Wast my time then<br />
Leave me alone<br />
Use me<br />
Turn me to stone<br />
Take another nail and<br />
Drive it home<br />
<br />
All my investments<br />
Get no return<br />
Just double-digit interest<br />
on nothing learned<br />
So why continue<br />
What do you earn<br />
By staying cool<br />
While I still burn<br />
<br />
When the bank forecloses<br />
On all your debts<br />
I'll still open up and<br />
You can dig through that<br />
<br />
Now you know<br />
I let myself go<br />
You used that up<br />
Now I'm sold<br />
So go ahead<br />
Sell me sloppy dead<br />
We both end up empty<br />
Let's repeat history</span>
