##baby needs oil  
(lyrics: Bergmann, music: Bergmann/Ray Fulber)  
album: Art Bergmann  
  
I've uncovered an unearthly delight  
TV battles in my desert night  
A superbowl of candy missles in flight  
Tell me why are all the newsmen white  
  
My baby needs oil  
She's been drinking like it's going out of style  
My baby's love's on the boil  
She's found a new land to soil  
  
I've uncovered an unearthly delight  
A million cars filled up on Exxon light  
My baby's engine's all rusted up tight  
She wants it every night  
  
My baby needs oil  
She's been drinking like it's going out of style  
My baby's love's on the boil  
She's found a new land to soil  
  
Boys and girls sleep in my desert night  
A lover's moon hangs in ghastly pale light  
Soldier's wives sleep with Elvis tonight  
I'm just trying to demystify  
  
My baby needs oil  
She's been drinking like it's going out of style  
My baby's love's on the boil  
She's found a new land to soil
