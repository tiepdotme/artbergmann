Who is it up there tonight  
Is that you in the spotlight  
Whose voice is coming out of that face  
Is that you or am I viewing tape  
  
Crackin' Up  
Crackin' Up  
  
Who are you trying to imitate  
Stop lying to me you're tempting fate  
I've never been one who's prone to violence  
But I've been keeping you under serveillance  
  
Crackin' Up  
Crackin' Up  
  
You're just a memory that makes me go astray  
You're just a memory that makes me go astray  
  
Crackin' Up  
Crackin' Up
