January 15, 1991... I feel like gettin' down  
on my knees and prayin'... I'm walkin'  
straight to my lover... In the east end  
they're comin' down... I've made a big  
decision towards the other. Walking  
through Japantown... Watching bums  
steal fruit from sidewalk stands... Without  
ever getting caught. I'm thinking about  
what Knowlton Nash said on the National  
News... About some war correspondent...  
Talking from the front... The thrill of  
getting shot at and missed... Me, I'm  
supposed to be writing a hit.  
  
I can't change this world  
It's too dangerous for all the boys and girls  
  
All the creeps and the jerks that pass  
me and harass me... They think I've got  
something... Something more... Something  
to give them... I blame them. I put my  
ear to the ground and listen fro the sound  
of falling change... Get out my wallet to  
look for a transfer to get out of range of  
people hating people for all weird  
reasons... Around the world they throw  
toys like an angry little brother in a  
sandbox... With the hatred of an unrequited  
lover... Or an envious kid sister.  
  
I can't change this world  
It's too dangerous for all the boys and girls  
  
Sit around all day just waiting for  
something clever to say... I'm losing my  
grip on this pen and feel like searching  
for my syringe again... Makes me hate  
my own song.  
  
I can't change this world  
It's too dangerous for all the boys and girls  
I can't change this world  
It's too dangerous for all the boys and girls  
I can't change this world
