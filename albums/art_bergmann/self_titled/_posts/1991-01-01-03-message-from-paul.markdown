I really love your long blonde hair  
You know I love the way you stare  
Would you still take me back if I'm sent home from there  
If I mistake him for someone who could ever care  
  
I got my message from Paul  
It could mean nothing at all  
I got my message from Paul  
It could mean nothing at all  
  
Bells keep ringing in my ears  
A blue light snaps from eye to eye  
I was hoping you felt the same  
Or have I just gone Insane  
  
I got my message from Paul  
Like a New Testament call  
Like walking down the Damascus Road  
Under some kind of heavy load  
  
Bells keep ringing in my ears  
A blue light snaps from eye to eye  
I was hoping you felt the same  
Or have I just gone insane  
  
I got my message from Paul  
I got my message from Paul  
It could mean nothing at all  
Could it be better than watching your long hair fall
