A neurotic old romance  
Is claiming young men  
No amount of destruction  
Will give you land  
  
Return to the holy land  
Let's see what you've planned  
What do the chosen few  
Choose for you  
Soon we'll be a page in your history  
But we will never meet again  
  
You think you're God's little gift to the world  
God's little gift to the world  
  
We're making advances  
Calling you up for national gain  
No amount of seduction  
Will ease the pain  
You';ll never get much from me  
There's just enough to go around  
  
You think you're God's little gift to the world  
God's little gift to the world  
  
Just like a girl who screams in your ear  
With the secret of the year  
Here's an army to fear  
  
They think they're god's little gift to the world  
God's little gift to the world
