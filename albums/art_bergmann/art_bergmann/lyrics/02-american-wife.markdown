<br />
A million American suits<br />
Fly to Eastern Europe<br />
They're free now<br />
Deliver American know-how<br />
Teach 'em how to vote<br />
More like how to buy votes<br />
<br />
Burn it down<br />
Start all over again<br />
<br />
Watch the reunited Germans<br />
You know they make the best business men<br />
But we've got a billion hamburgers<br />
Free coke<br />
White collar criminals<br />
And money for dope<br />
<br />
Burn it down<br />
Start all over again<br />
<br />
You bed me<br />
You wed me<br />
American wife<br />
You led me<br />
You bled me<br />
American wife<br />
Burn it down<br />
<br />
The circus goes to Moscow<br />
And we're gonna bring along a rock show<br />
They tell me Leningrad's a-go-go<br />
So don't be slow with the blow Joe<br />
<br />
Burn it down<br />
Start all over again<br />
<br />
Please don't be waiting too long<br />
Please don't be waiting too long</span>
