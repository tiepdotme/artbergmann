<br />
Her first breath<br />
Is drawn through a cigarette<br />
Her first drink<br />
Last night's scotch<br />
Just to wet her cracked lips<br />
She looks at the man beside her<br />
Lying in the bed<br />
She doesn't know his name<br />
She only hopes he's not dead<br />
She feels like<br />
Marianne Faithfull<br />
Marianne Faithfull<br />
She hopes at the end of the day<br />
Someone remembers her name<br />
<br />
She goes out for some late afternoon work<br />
Down in Times Square<br />
Maybe she'll meet Steven Tyler<br />
On a double dare<br />
Turning tricks in a theater<br />
She's a creature<br />
In her own double feature<br />
She feels like<br />
Marianne Faithfull<br />
Marianne Faithfull<br />
She hopes at the end of the this day<br />
Someone remembers her name<br />
At the end of the day<br />
Remember her name<br />
I do<br />
<br />
It's Marianne Faithfull<br />
Marianne Faithfull<br />
Marianne Faithfull<br />
Marianne Faithfull<br />
On a good day<br />
Or a bad day</span>
