<br />
If she could sing<br />
I wonder what she'd say<br />
Would she do as I've done<br />
And put me on display<br />
Use me for fun<br />
As I have done<br />
As I have done<br />
She'd make me shudder and run<br />
<br />
If she could sing<br />
Just like me<br />
Would she bring<br />
Heartache and misery<br />
Throw me to the Huns<br />
As I have done<br />
As I have done</span>
<div>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0">She'd make me shudder and run<br />
<br />
Maybe there is something someone<br />
Could have said or done<br />
To change my mind<br />
I don't think so this time<br />
<br />
When she finds her voice I'll listen<br />
For a clue to what was missing<br />
When I placed the emphasis<br />
On mine<br />
<br />
If she could sing<br />
I wonder what she'd say<br />
If she could sing<br />
Just like me<br />
<br />
She would call me down<br />
She would call me down<br />
She would call me down<br />
She would call me down</span>
