<br />
I really love your long blonde hair<br />
You know I love the way you stare<br />
Would you still take me back if I'm sent home from there<br />
If I mistake him for someone who could ever care<br />
<br />
I got my message from Paul<br />
It could mean nothing at all<br />
I got my message from Paul<br />
It could mean nothing at all<br />
<br />
Bells keep ringing in my ears<br />
A blue light snaps from eye to eye<br />
I was hoping you felt the same<br />
Or have I just gone Insane<br />
<br />
I got my message from Paul<br />
Like a New Testament call<br />
Like walking down the Damascus Road<br />
Under some kind of heavy load<br />
<br />
Bells keep ringing in my ears<br />
A blue light snaps from eye to eye<br />
I was hoping you felt the same<br />
Or have I just gone insane<br />
<br />
I got my message from Paul<br />
I got my message from Paul<br />
It could mean nothing at all<br />
Could it be better than watching your long hair fall</span>
