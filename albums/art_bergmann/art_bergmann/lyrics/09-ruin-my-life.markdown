<br />
Ruin my life<br />
Open my eyes to the broad daylight<br />
Take me home<br />
Get me to bed by midnight<br />
Ruin my life<br />
Open my eyes to the broad daylight<br />
Take me home<br />
Keep me safe and warm<br />
Do what you like<br />
Unless your freedom is the price<br />
Take me home<br />
Keep me from all harm<br />
You say that I can do what I want<br />
Hey hey I'm not that strong<br />
You say that I don't get it<br />
I'm ready to admit it<br />
That I can't shake it off<br />
Ruin my life<br />
Hold your nose<br />
When I come back in a week in somebody's clothes<br />
Smell this rose<br />
Keep me from an overdose<br />
Make me hope<br />
Make me hope I die when I get old<br />
Take my drugs<br />
And throw 'em out the window<br />
Change my bed, change my head<br />
Everything was going wrong until now<br />
Take every promise I've ever broken<br />
Turn them into a vow<br />
Is this ring really dipped<br />
In a thousand drinks<br />
I'd give it all up<br />
Just to sink inside her experience<br />
Ruin my life</span>
