<br />
Who is it up there tonight<br />
Is that you in the spotlight<br />
Whose voice is coming out of that face<br />
Is that you or am I viewing tape<br />
<br />
Crackin' Up<br />
Crackin' Up<br />
<br />
Who are you trying to imitate<br />
Stop lying to me you're tempting fate<br />
I've never been one who's prone to violence<br />
But I've been keeping you under serveillance<br />
<br />
Crackin' Up<br />
Crackin' Up<br />
<br />
You're just a memory that makes me go astray<br />
You're just a memory that makes me go astray<br />
<br />
Crackin' Up<br />
Crackin' Up</span>
