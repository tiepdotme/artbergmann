<br />
I've uncovered an unearthly delight<br />
TV battles in my desert night<br />
A superbowl of candy missles in flight<br />
Tell me why are all the newsmen white<br />
<br />
My baby needs oil<br />
She's been drinking like it's going out of style<br />
My baby's love's on the boil<br />
She's found a new land to soil<br />
<br />
I've uncovered an unearthly delight<br />
A million cars filled up on Exxon light<br />
My baby's engine's all rusted up tight<br />
She wants it every night<br />
<br />
My baby needs oil<br />
She's been drinking like it's going out of style<br />
My baby's love's on the boil<br />
She's found a new land to soil<br />
<br />
Boys and girls sleep in my desert night<br />
A lover's moon hangs in ghastly pale light<br />
Soldier's wives sleep with Elvis tonight<br />
I'm just trying to demystify<br />
<br />
My baby needs oil<br />
She's been drinking like it's going out of style<br />
My baby's love's on the boil<br />
She's found a new land to soil</span>
