A million American suits  
Fly to Eastern Europe  
They're free now  
Deliver American know-how  
Teach 'em how to vote  
More like how to buy votes  
  
Burn it down  
Start all over again  
  
Watch the reunited Germans  
You know they make the best business men  
But we've got a billion hamburgers  
Free coke  
White collar criminals  
And money for dope  
  
Burn it down  
Start all over again  
  
You bed me  
You wed me  
American wife  
You led me  
You bled me  
American wife  
Burn it down  
  
The circus goes to Moscow  
And we're gonna bring along a rock show  
They tell me Leningrad's a-go-go  
So don't be slow with the blow Joe  
  
Burn it down  
Start all over again  
  
Please don't be waiting too long  
Please don't be waiting too long
