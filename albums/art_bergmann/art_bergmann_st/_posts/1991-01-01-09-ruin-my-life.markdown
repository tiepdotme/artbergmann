Ruin my life  
Open my eyes to the broad daylight  
Take me home  
Get me to bed by midnight  
Ruin my life  
Open my eyes to the broad daylight  
Take me home  
Keep me safe and warm  
Do what you like  
Unless your freedom is the price  
Take me home  
Keep me from all harm  
You say that I can do what I want  
Hey hey I'm not that strong  
You say that I don't get it  
I'm ready to admit it  
That I can't shake it off  
Ruin my life  
Hold your nose  
When I come back in a week in somebody's clothes  
Smell this rose  
Keep me from an overdose  
Make me hope  
Make me hope I die when I get old  
Take my drugs  
And throw 'em out the window  
Change my bed, change my head  
Everything was going wrong until now  
Take every promise I've ever broken  
Turn them into a vow  
Is this ring really dipped  
In a thousand drinks  
I'd give it all up  
Just to sink inside her experience  
Ruin my life
