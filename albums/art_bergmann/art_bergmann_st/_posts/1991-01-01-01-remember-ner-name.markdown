Her first breath  
Is drawn through a cigarette  
Her first drink  
Last night's scotch  
Just to wet her cracked lips  
She looks at the man beside her  
Lying in the bed  
She doesn't know his name  
She only hopes he's not dead  
She feels like  
Marianne Faithfull  
Marianne Faithfull  
She hopes at the end of the day  
Someone remembers her name  
  
She goes out for some late afternoon work  
Down in Times Square  
Maybe she'll meet Steven Tyler  
On a double dare  
Turning tricks in a theater  
She's a creature  
In her own double feature  
She feels like  
Marianne Faithfull  
Marianne Faithfull  
She hopes at the end of the this day  
Someone remembers her name  
At the end of the day  
Remember her name  
I do  
  
It's Marianne Faithfull  
Marianne Faithfull  
Marianne Faithfull  
Marianne Faithfull  
On a good day  
Or a bad day
