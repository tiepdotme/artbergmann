If she could sing  
I wonder what she'd say  
Would she do as I've done  
And put me on display  
Use me for fun  
As I have done  
As I have done  
She'd make me shudder and run  
  
If she could sing  
Just like me  
Would she bring  
Heartache and misery  
Throw me to the Huns  
As I have done  
As I have done  
  
She'd make me shudder and run  
  
Maybe there is something someone  
Could have said or done  
To change my mind  
I don't think so this time  
  
When she finds her voice I'll listen  
For a clue to what was missing  
When I placed the emphasis  
On mine  
  
If she could sing  
I wonder what she'd say  
If she could sing  
Just like me  
  
She would call me down  
She would call me down  
She would call me down  
She would call me down
