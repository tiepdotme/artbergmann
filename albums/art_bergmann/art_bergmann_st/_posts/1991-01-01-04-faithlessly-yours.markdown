God's got an answer in that jukebox  
I pick the wrong song every time  
I know my song is in that jukebox  
And I've been suckered for the last time  
  
How could I be so silly  
How could I be faithlessly yours  
  
God hid an answer in her body  
I've been in the wrong room for so long  
I found no question in her body  
I'm in the room where I belong  
  
How could I be so silly  
How could I be faithlessly yours  
  
Now that the evidence is in  
Now that the evidence is in  
  
God placed an ad in her paper  
A cryptic clue without a crossword  
How could I have known she worked that paper  
The sweetest sound the world has heard  
  
How could I be so silly  
How could I be faithlessly yours
