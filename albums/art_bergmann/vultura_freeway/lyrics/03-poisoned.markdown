##poisoned  
(Bergmann)  
album: Vultura Freeway  
  
I've been thinking  
About a new way of talking  
You've been talking  
About a new way of walking  
What have I got to lose  
This time I'm talking to you  
And I'm walking out  
Walking out on you  
  
The snake went o my head  
It's already crossed my mind  
Like something dies on the vine  
It's already crossed my mind  
  
I've been watching  
Looking at you looking at him  
You've been watching  
Looking at me looking at her  
What have we got to lose  
Here's what we'll do  
You'll walk up to him  
I'll walk up to her  
  
Chorus  
  
And I wake up every morning  
And there's always something missing I know  
No matter how good you are...you know  
I've been wishing  
The next time we go to town  
You know the guys there  
Who tend to keep us on the ground  
What have we got to lose  
Take your .22  
Put it in your purse  
They'll get what they deserve  
Get what they deserve  
  
Chorus
