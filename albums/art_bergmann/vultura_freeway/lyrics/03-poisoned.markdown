<br />
I've been thinking<br />
About a new way of talking<br />
You've been talking <br />
About a new way of walking<br />
What have I got to lose<br />
This time I'm talking to you<br />
And I'm walking out<br />
Walking out on you<br />
<br />
The snake went o my head<br />
It's already crossed my mind<br />
Like something dies on the vine<br />
It's already crossed my mind<br />
<br />
I've been watching<br />
Looking at you looking at him<br />
You've been watching<br />
Looking at me looking at her<br />
What have we got to lose<br />
Here's what we'll do<br />
You'll walk up to him<br />
I'll walk up to her<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
<br />
And I wake up every morning<br />
And there's always something missing I know<br />
No matter how good you are...you know<br />
I've been wishing<br />
The next time we go to town<br />
You know the guys there<br />
Who tend to keep us on the ground<br />
What have we got to lose<br />
Take your .22<br />
Put it in your purse<br />
They'll get what they deserve<br />
Get what they deserve<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
