<br />
A neurotic old romance<br />
Is claiming young men<br />
No amount of destruction<br />
Will give you land<br />
<br />
Return to the holy land<br />
Let's see what you've planned<br />
What do the chosen few<br />
Choose for you<br />
Soon we'll be a page in your history<br />
But we will never meet again<br />
<br />
You think you're God's little gift to the world<br />
God's little gift to the world<br />
<br />
We're making advances<br />
Calling you up for national gain<br />
No amount of seduction<br />
Will ease the pain<br />
You';ll never get much from me<br />
There's just enough to go around<br />
<br />
You think you're God's little gift to the world<br />
God's little gift to the world<br />
<br />
Just like a girl who screams in your ear<br />
With the secret of the year<br />
Here's an army to fear<br />
<br />
They think they're god's little gift to the world<br />
God's little gift to the world<br />
