<i>album: Vultura Freeway</i><br />
<br />
I've been walking these aisles<br />
With no strings attached<br />
Someone always preaches<br />
There must be a catch<br />
But the talk's always cheap<br />
And who's got a match<br />
I've been walking these halls<br />
Heads shrink back one by one<br />
Into dimming doorways<br />
I'm closing in on fun<br />
But the light at the end<br />
It keeps inviting me in<br />
But what can I do about my dream<br />
What can you do about your nightmare<br />
<br />
Get packed get out fade to black lights out<br />
Get packed get out fade to black lights out<br />
<br />
I've been walking these streets<br />
Past blackened buildings glowing red<br />
And the rain always sticks<br />
Tot the gray and the dead<br />
But the light in your corner<br />
That light that adorns you<br />
Always looks good<br />
<br />
What can you do about my dream<br />
What can we do about your nightmare<br />
There's a deal you can make<br />
To get out of this place<br />
It'll make you feel safe<br />
But don't ever show your face<br />
Down here again<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
