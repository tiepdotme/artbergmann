##fade to black  
(Bergmann)  
album: Vultura Freeway  
  
I've been walking these aisles  
With no strings attached  
Someone always preaches  
There must be a catch  
But the talk's always cheap  
And who's got a match  
I've been walking these halls  
Heads shrink back one by one  
Into dimming doorways  
I'm closing in on fun  
But the light at the end  
It keeps inviting me in  
But what can I do about my dream  
What can you do about your nightmare  
  
Get packed get out fade to black lights out  
Get packed get out fade to black lights out  
  
I've been walking these streets  
Past blackened buildings glowing red  
And the rain always sticks  
Tot the gray and the dead  
But the light in your corner  
That light that adorns you  
Always looks good  
  
What can you do about my dream  
What can we do about your nightmare  
There's a deal you can make  
To get out of this place  
It'll make you feel safe  
But don't ever show your face  
Down here again  
  
Chorus
