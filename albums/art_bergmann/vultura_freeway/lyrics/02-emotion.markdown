<i>album: Vultura Freeway + Poisoned EP</i><br />
<br />
A woman shrieks<br />
From the apartment below<br />
Is it noisy love<br />
Or a bruise-laying blow<br />
<br />
Domestic bliss<br />
Dirty needle hiss<br />
Cheap broken street life<br />
<br />
Just another fight<br />
On a social housing row<br />
The synthesizer swells<br />
On my radio<br />
<br />
Gimme some emotion<br />
Something I can chew on<br />
Some honesty and hatred<br />
Some lustful embraces<br />
<br />
Oh what a lovely<br />
Sounding world<br />
Hey what a lovely <br />
Sounding world<br />
<br />
Incoming news <br />
From a foreign battleground<br />
No choir of angels<br />
Sings a soothing sound<br />
<br />
Kids die in a crossfire<br />
Of politics gone mad<br />
Ideologues <br />
Dogs shitting led<br />
<br />
Mom and dad wait at home<br />
For a knock on the door<br />
The synthesizer swells <br />
On my radio<br />
<br />
Gimme some emotion<br />
Something I can chew on<br />
Some honesty and hatred<br />
Some lustful embraces<br />
<br />
Oh what a lovely<br />
Sounding world<br />
Hey what a lovely <br />
Sounding world...<br />
<br />
Down in the street<br />
Who's getting beat<br />
For something to eat<br />
<br />
Why it's an ugly old man<br />
Brown bagging it again<br />
Digging out his lunch<br />
From a garbage can<br />
<br />
His broken bones don't register<br />
In his broken mind<br />
He don't need no doctor<br />
To see his heart<br />
Beats way out of time<br />
<br />
Gimme some emotion<br />
Something I can chew on<br />
Some honesty and hatred<br />
Some lustful embraces<br />
<br />
Hey what a lovely<br />
Sounding world<br />
Hey what a lovely <br />
Sounding world...<br />
