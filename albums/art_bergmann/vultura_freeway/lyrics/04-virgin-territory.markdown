<br />
Someone's sending signals<br />
Rising up through the sky<br />
There's no cry<br />
Desert moon and mesa<br />
Takes me to the ancient hills<br />
To the devil we know<br />
We're going home<br />
Days dawn bright<br />
In virgin land<br />
We're going back<br />
Even tho' we realize<br />
<br />
That what we've lost<br />
What we want to find<br />
Disappears as the world grinds<br />
If you want I've got time<br />
To search again for the old trail<br />
That leads to the site<br />
Let's go blind<br />
Days dawn bright<br />
In virgin land<br />
We're going home<br />
<br />
There's something I'd rather see in the day<br />
And there's something I'd rather feel when I wake<br />
Take the time that rushes by<br />
Cuz someone's sending signals<br />
The devil we know<br />
Let's go blind<br />
Days dawn bright<br />
In virgin land<br />
We're going home<br />
<br />
