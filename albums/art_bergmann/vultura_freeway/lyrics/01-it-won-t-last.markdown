<br />
So much to fascinate<br />
You find a life-long mate<br />
We raise our cubs and pups<br />
And go out every night<br />
Your lips are kissed to rawness<br />
Your steps are slack and boneless<br />
Body screams the question<br />
But your mind ticks back no answer<br />
No, you can't stay a lifetime<br />
Maybe just this weekend<br />
Do you know something I don't <br />
It won't <br />
It won't last<br />
<br />
Just when you're groomed and smiling<br />
An instinctive voice reminds you<br />
Humans flying in<br />
So we scurried to the den<br />
I lick your face my mate<br />
As we lay down to wait<br />
I love you like the breeze<br />
We were here before they learned to read<br />
You can't stay a lifetime<br />
We've got just this weekend<br />
Do you know something I don't <br />
It won't <br />
It won't last<br />
<br />
You and I we've lived our lives<br />
By instinct, knowing what we are<br />
But now my darling, we'll not cry<br />
As we run from the final shot<br />
<br />
So much to fascinate<br />
You find a life-long mate<br />
We raise our cubs and pups <br />
And go out every night<br />
The pains they take to stop<br />
The beating of our hearts<br />
The destruction of our senses<br />
Our growing independence<br />
No you can't stay a lifetime<br />
We've got just this weekend<br />
Do you know something I don't even know<br />
It won't <br />
It won't last<br />
