##it won't last  
(Bergmann/Bill Scherk/Gord Nicholl)  
album: Vultura Freeway + Poisoned EP  
  
So much to fascinate  
You find a life-long mate  
We raise our cubs and pups  
And go out every night  
Your lips are kissed to rawness  
Your steps are slack and boneless  
Body screams the question  
But your mind ticks back no answer  
No, you can't stay a lifetime  
Maybe just this weekend  
Do you know something I don't  
It won't  
It won't last  
  
Just when you're groomed and smiling  
An instinctive voice reminds you  
Humans flying in  
So we scurried to the den  
I lick your face my mate  
As we lay down to wait  
I love you like the breeze  
We were here before they learned to read  
You can't stay a lifetime  
We've got just this weekend  
Do you know something I don't  
It won't  
It won't last  
  
You and I we've lived our lives  
By instinct, knowing what we are  
But now my darling, we'll not cry  
As we run from the final shot  
  
So much to fascinate  
You find a life-long mate  
We raise our cubs and pups  
And go out every night  
The pains they take to stop  
The beating of our hearts  
The destruction of our senses  
Our growing independence  
No you can't stay a lifetime  
We've got just this weekend  
Do you know something I don't even know  
It won't  
It won't last
