Tell me what's the difference  
In you and me and what you'd like to see  
We all want a better life  
No questions of heaven or hell  
Answers in black or white  
  
But I'll be living in another gray area  
  
Who'll want anyone anymore  
We just open our books and close the doors  
No one can be innocent  
Resigned to it  
And born without it  
  
When we get to the end and we find what we're after  
A room filled with friends ringing with peals of laughter  
And we spit in the face of any worldwide disaster  
But I don't want to be alone tonight  
  
I'll be living in another gray area  
  
Call me if you get the chance  
Hey what's going on  
Do you still dance  
  
Where you gonna find someone who's innocent  
We're all losers here until we win  
And when we get to the end and we find what we're after  
A room filled with friends ringing with peals of laughter  
And we spit in the face of any worldwide disaster  
But I don't want to be alone tonight  
  
I'll be living in another gray area
