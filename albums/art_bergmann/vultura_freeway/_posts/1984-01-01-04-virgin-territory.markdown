Someone's sending signals  
Rising up through the sky  
There's no cry  
Desert moon and mesa  
Takes me to the ancient hills  
To the devil we know  
We're going home  
Days dawn bright  
In virgin land  
We're going back  
Even tho' we realize  
  
That what we've lost  
What we want to find  
Disappears as the world grinds  
If you want I've got time  
To search again for the old trail  
That leads to the site  
Let's go blind  
Days dawn bright  
In virgin land  
We're going home  
  
There's something I'd rather see in the day  
And there's something I'd rather feel when I wake  
Take the time that rushes by  
Cuz someone's sending signals  
The devil we know  
Let's go blind  
Days dawn bright  
In virgin land  
We're going home
