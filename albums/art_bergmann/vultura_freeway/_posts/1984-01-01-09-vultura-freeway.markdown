It's not summer  
But it's hot today  
This ain't no holiday  
Vultura Freeway  
  
Who could ever understand  
What it costs to be in the band  
A common knowledge of our fate  
Like an agreement between church and state  
Friendship lies in unholy ties  
No cheap entertainment on this trip  
No sideshows out on the strip  
Just the wind and gas and whatever drug  
That through our bodies rip  
I ain't in no business grip  
  
Chorus  
  
A common bond and what we need  
And when it runs out you'll find a friend indeed  
When he died it was with a scream  
On a roadway strewn with dreams  
Blood isn't always what it seems  
Ninety miles an hour in a blue tin box  
We were still laughing&nbsp; when we hit the rocks  
And just within reach of that golden beach  
As the waves crashed over us  
Discontented dispossessed and desperate  
  
Chorus  
  
Meanwhile  
All along the new gold coast  
They raise their glasses in a back-stabbing toast  
On their knees to suck on the host  
A warm death awaits you  
A warm death awaits you  
Take my hand and we'll go to hell  
Ugly into beautiful  
  
It's not summer, but it's hot today  
This ain't no holiday  
The law disappears today  
Vultura Freeway
