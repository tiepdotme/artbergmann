<br />
I'm sorry<br />
It's just that you're new<br />
Can I take<br />
My revenge out on you<br />
<br />
What did you say<br />
About later today<br />
Did you mention a time<br />
Was that just a lie<br />
<br />
You're making me wait<br />
Please don't be late<br />
You're making me hate you<br />
I'd never rape you<br />
<br />
You're strange<br />
You get stranger on me<br />
When you come on me<br />
You get obvious on me<br />
<br />
I'm not like those other guys<br />
I wouldn't bake you<br />
Like they did in 1939<br />
Then you go and spoil it all<br />
By saying something stupid<br />
Like I love you<br />
<br />
You're strange<br />
You get stranger on me<br />
When you come on me<br />
You get obvious on me<br />
Come on<br />
Get obvious on me
