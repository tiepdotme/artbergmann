<br />
This old town is filled with sin,<br />
It'll swallow you in<br />
If you've got some money to burn.<br />
Take it home right away,<br />
You've got three years to pay<br />
But Satan is waiting his turn<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house.<br />
It seems like this whole town's insane<br />
On the thirty-first floor your gold plated door<br />
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The scientists say<br />
It'll all wash away<br />
But we don't believe any more<br />
Cause we've got our recruits<br />
And our green mohair suits<br />
So please show you ID At the door.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A friend came around.<br />
Tried to clean up this town,<br />
His ideas made some people mad.<br />
But he trusted his crowd,<br />
So he spoke right out loud<br />
And they lost the best friend they had<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the thirty-first floor your gold plated door<br />
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain</span>
