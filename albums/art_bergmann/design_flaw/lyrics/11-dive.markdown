Got a mouthful of ashes  
And I got some rope  
You got a pocketful of plastic  
I guess you&rsquo;ve never been broke  
Long-distance phone call  
From a noisy bar  
Says they&rsquo;ll be digging  
Through your trash one day  
I said they already are  
Hush now baby  
Don&rsquo;t you cry  
Dry your eyes  
Watch me dive  
Got a mouthful of ashes  
And I got some rope  
You got a pocketful of plastic  
Guess you&rsquo;ve never been broke  
There&rsquo;s no secrets  
No they don&rsquo;t have one  
Watch &lsquo;em find some food today  
Before it rots in the sun  
I long for the night  
Where I can hide  
Maybe dream up a life  
Instead of living this lie  
Yeah, I love the night  
I feel safe and warm inside  
Instead of living this lie  
Got a mouthful of ashes  
And I got a gun  
You got a pocketful of tragic  
You always had your fun  
Kid says where&rsquo;s the car  
And where are you parked  
Hmm&hellip;maybe in the garage  
Where I was a star  
Hush now baby  
Don&rsquo;t you cry  
Dry your tears  
And watch me dive
