<br />
Got a mouthful of ashes<br />
And I got some rope<br />
You got a pocketful of plastic<br />
I guess you&rsquo;ve never been broke<br />
Long-distance phone call<br />
From a noisy bar<br />
Says they&rsquo;ll be digging <br />
Through your trash one day<br />
I said they already are<br />
Hush now baby<br />
Don&rsquo;t you cry<br />
Dry your eyes<br />
Watch me dive<br />
Got a mouthful of ashes<br />
And I got some rope<br />
You got a pocketful of plastic<br />
Guess you&rsquo;ve never been broke<br />
There&rsquo;s no secrets<br />
No they don&rsquo;t have one<br />
Watch &lsquo;em find some food today <br />
Before it rots in the sun<br />
I long for the night<br />
Where I can hide<br />
Maybe dream up a life<br />
Instead of living this lie<br />
Yeah, I love the night<br />
I feel safe and warm inside<br />
Instead of living this lie<br />
Got a mouthful of ashes<br />
And I got a gun<br />
You got a pocketful of tragic<br />
You always had your fun<br />
Kid says where&rsquo;s the car<br />
And where are you parked<br />
Hmm&hellip;maybe in the garage<br />
Where I was a star<br />
Hush now baby<br />
Don&rsquo;t you cry<br />
Dry your tears<br />
And watch me dive</span><br />
