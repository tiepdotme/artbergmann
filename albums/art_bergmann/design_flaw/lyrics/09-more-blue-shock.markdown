<br />
Is it really true?<br />
You're not coming<br />
Round here no more<br />
No face at my door<br />
No jokes that had us<br />
Rolling on the floor<br />
<br />
You said you didn't like<br />
The spare-ribs<br />
In the restaurant<br />
But I saw the papers<br />
The police gave you<br />
They charged you<br />
With assult<br />
<br />
Now you've got<br />
<br />
More blue shock more blue shock<br />
More blue pills more blue pills<br />
It reminded me of a friend<br />
They found him hanging<br />
From a light fixture<br />
In the middle of his room<br />
Just before breakfast<br />
Swinging in the gloom<br />
And I couldn't help thinking<br />
This was gonna happen to you<br />
All screwed up in your head<br />
In your cell<br />
Swinging in the gloom<br />
<br />
More blue shock<br />
More blue pills<br />
<br />
Is it really true<br />
You're not coming<br />
'Round here no more<br />
Locked up once<br />
And let out<br />
Never more<br />
<br />
More blue shock<br />
More blue pills</span>
