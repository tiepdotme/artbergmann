Is it really true?  
You're not coming  
Round here no more  
No face at my door  
No jokes that had us  
Rolling on the floor  
  
You said you didn't like  
The spare-ribs  
In the restaurant  
But I saw the papers  
The police gave you  
They charged you  
With assult  
  
Now you've got  
  
More blue shock more blue shock  
More blue pills more blue pills  
It reminded me of a friend  
They found him hanging  
From a light fixture  
In the middle of his room  
Just before breakfast  
Swinging in the gloom  
And I couldn't help thinking  
This was gonna happen to you  
All screwed up in your head  
In your cell  
Swinging in the gloom  
  
More blue shock  
More blue pills  
  
Is it really true  
You're not coming  
'Round here no more  
Locked up once  
And let out  
Never more  
  
More blue shock  
More blue pills
