God's got an answer in that jukebox<br />
I pick the wrong song every time<br />
I know my song is in that jukebox<br />
And I've been suckered for the last time<br />
<br />
How could I be so silly<br />
How could I be faithlessly yours<br />
<br />
God hid an answer in her body<br />
I've been in the wrong room for so long<br />
I found no question in her body<br />
I'm in the room where I belong<br />
<br />
How could I be so silly<br />
How could I be faithlessly yours<br />
<br />
Now that the evidence is in<br />
Now that the evidence is in<br />
<br />
God placed an ad in her paper<br />
A cryptic clue without a crossword<br />
How could I have known she worked that paper<br />
The sweetest sound the world has heard<br />
<br />
How could I be so silly<br />
How could I be faithlessly yours</span>
