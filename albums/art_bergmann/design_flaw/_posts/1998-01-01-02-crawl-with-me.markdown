I was lying on the table  
Prone and oblivious  
You were staring at me  
Intentions obvious  
I thought I might be able  
To make something  
Out of this  
We shook hands  
Later we'd kiss  
You asked where  
We were going  
I said that depends  
If we fall in love  
It will be your living end  
  
Everybody wants  
What they can't have  
You could have me  
But you won't keep  
Opportunity knocks  
Only once  
I said get lost  
Now here's your chance  
  
Crawl with me  
Crawl with me home  
Wast my time then  
Leave me alone  
Use me  
Turn me to stone  
Take another nail and  
Drive it home  
  
All my investments  
Get no return  
Just double-digit interest  
on nothing learned  
So why continue  
What do you earn  
By staying cool  
While I still burn  
  
When the bank forecloses  
On all your debts  
I'll still open up and  
You can dig through that  
  
Now you know  
I let myself go  
You used that up  
Now I'm sold  
So go ahead  
Sell me sloppy dead  
We both end up empty  
Let's repeat history
