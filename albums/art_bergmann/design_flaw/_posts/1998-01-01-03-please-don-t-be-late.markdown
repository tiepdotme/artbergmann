I'm sorry  
It's just that you're new  
Can I take  
My revenge out on you  
  
What did you say  
About later today  
Did you mention a time  
Was that just a lie  
  
You're making me wait  
Please don't be late  
You're making me hate you  
I'd never rape you  
  
You're strange  
You get stranger on me  
When you come on me  
You get obvious on me  
  
I'm not like those other guys  
I wouldn't bake you  
Like they did in 1939  
Then you go and spoil it all  
By saying something stupid  
Like I love you  
  
You're strange  
You get stranger on me  
When you come on me  
You get obvious on me  
Come on  
Get obvious on me
