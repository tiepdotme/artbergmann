Janis never gave it  
Away freely  
But I knew we'd make it  
After one look in her eye  
Then we got all  
Touchy feely  
I'm impulsive  
Away we did fly  
I used to be convulsive  
Now I'm hap-hap-hap-happy  
  
She hit me  
At the speed of lightning  
  
Joanna always  
Kept her head up  
She was a nazi  
She caught me  
On the chin  
I never got fed-up  
You know I told her  
&quot;I never hit women  
If you get any bolder  
I'm gonna have to be  
Tough tough tough&quot;  
  
She hit me  
At the speed of lightning  
  
What will I call  
The girl this time  
The little harlot  
Is a real drug slut  
Now she's a friend of mine  
She'll forget about me  
Now that she's in this song  
I knew all along  
That we were  
Wrong wrong wrong  
  
She hit me  
At the speed of lightning
