For seven days and  
Seven nights  
I stayed up with him  
My best friend  
He's a dog  
We stayed  
Down in the market  
We thought it was  
So cool  
Like little Jerusalem  
  
The chicken blood  
Ran in the gutters  
Man did it stink  
They played disco  
Of the ages  
It could turn a man  
Into a racist  
  
Anyway he says  
I've been burned so many times  
I'm going out tonight  
And kill every  
Black man i see  
I said &quot;uh,uh  
Not me!&quot;  
  
I have got  
A big confession  
I'll be as clean  
As the new ss  
As orderly as a nurse  
Just like a doctor  
As clean  
As this earth  
So he took  
His favourite red knife  
Stuck it in  
Some dealser's thigh  
Took all his dope  
What a mess  
My my  
  
He came back up  
To our flat  
Pulled a dirty fit  
Out of the garbage  
Came into my room  
He said &quot;You've gotta help me&quot;  
I said &quot;Hello you old devil&quot;  
And smashed him  
Right in the teeth  
  
I will be as clean as  
Christ on the cross  
I've been so dirty  
I will be as clean as  
Christ on your wall  
Restitution for everyone  
Who died along the way  
Having fun
