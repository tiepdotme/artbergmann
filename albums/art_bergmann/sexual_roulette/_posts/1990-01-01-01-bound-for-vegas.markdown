Load up the trucks  
Don't forget the make-up  
We've got the six semis  
For the money  
None for the show  
We've got our costumes ready  
Got to go go go  
  
Bound for Vegas  
Bound for Vegas  
  
Who's got the map  
Who's gonna navigate  
We've got six shows  
On the strip  
It's a sellout  
Wayne Newton doesn't  
Want us to be late  
  
It's in my heart  
I'm making a financial start  
  
They call me the performer  
I guess they always will  
Call me the entertainer  
Don't retire me yet  
I ain't over the hill  
I ain't had my fill  
  
It's in my heart  
I'm making a financial start  
I'm a never was  
Trying to be a has-been  
A has-been on the come-back trail  
Come-back to me  
On the Vegas scene  
By the age of fifty  
  
Good-bye Vancouver, Good-bye Toronto  
Good-bye New York  
Even the St. Louis blues  
I said buy Detroit, buy New York  
Ain't going Route 66  
Give me I-85  
  
Bound for Vegas  
Bound for Vegas  
  
It's a sellout
