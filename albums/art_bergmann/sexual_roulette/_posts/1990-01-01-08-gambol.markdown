I like to gamble  
I'm not talking  
Sports or fucking real estate  
I like to gamble  
Take your blackjacks  
Russian roulette  
Or racing stakes  
I like to gamble  
I don't like craps  
But your sanity will do  
Not like Rambo  
I'd prefer a little more  
Reality in my food  
If you please  
  
I like to travel  
I like the food i meet  
The people i eat  
Travel  
A trip out of town  
Or a nervous breakdown  
I'd rather straddle  
This razorblade  
Than sit on that fence  
Travel  
No matter where you live  
You're still the same pig you've always been  
  
The money  
Burned a hole  
In his pants  
The money  
Burned a hole  
In his head  
  
I like to gamble  
That's why I walk  
These streets  
All night every night  
I like to waffle  
Does a man like me  
Really need a wife  
I like to scramble  
Look for some  
Good German wine  
Or a good  
German knife  
I like to gamble  
What's more important  
Your money  
Or your life
