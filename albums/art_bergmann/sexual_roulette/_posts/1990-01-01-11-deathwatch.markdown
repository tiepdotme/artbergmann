It's a new deal  
With the same deck of cards  
Any old play  
We're fashioning new parts  
  
I get too nervous  
I can't touch you now  
I get so excited  
But I'll catch you somehow  
  
Try and make sense  
With a pair of loaded dice  
Is like having faith  
In some guy called Christ  
  
I get too nervous  
I can't touch you now  
I get so excited  
But I'll catch you somehow  
(Catch you somehow)  
  
Our luck  
Has now run its course  
Allwagers lost  
On a fast dark horse  
  
I get too nervous  
I can't touch you now  
I get so excited  
But I'll catch you somehow  
(Catch you somehow)  
  
It's a crap shoot  
With you as victim  
Will you survive  
The odds are slim to none  
  
I get too nervous  
I can't touch you now  
I get so excited  
But I'll catch you somehow  
(Catch you somehow)  
  
When the waiting is over  
When the days are through  
And I relax with you  
We'll fall in love  
Yeah, we'll all fall in love  
Again  
  
(Yeah, right)  
  
Yeah, we'll all fall in lovewhen I piss on your grave  
....???
