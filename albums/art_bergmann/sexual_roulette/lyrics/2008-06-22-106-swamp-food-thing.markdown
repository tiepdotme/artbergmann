<span style="color: #c0c0c0">(Bergmann)<br />
<i>album: Sexual Roulette</i><br />
<br />
From Finland<br />
To New Orleans<br />
You wouldn't believe<br />
What I've seen<br />
People jump my train<br />
They jump my scene<br />
And it's all<br />
For a plate of beans<br />
Food<br />
<br />
Been looking high<br />
Been looking low<br />
What gotta know is<br />
How low can you go<br />
I'm not a picky eater<br />
You know what i mean<br />
I like to lick<br />
My plate clean<br />
<br />
Psychotic women<br />
They abound<br />
You wouldn't believe<br />
The men that I've found<br />
But I'm not a picky eater<br />
You know what I mean<br />
I like to lick<br />
My plate clean<br />
<br />
I know how hard<br />
It can be to find<br />
A friend at the end of the day<br />
If you can count them<br />
On two hands<br />
At the end of your life<br />
Consider yourself lucky<br />
<br />
Neurotic, Hispanic, Teutonic food<br />
<br />
Bubonic, psychotic, Germanic, blah, etc, food
