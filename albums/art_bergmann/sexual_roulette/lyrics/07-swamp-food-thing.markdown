##swamp food thing  
(Bergmann)  
album: Sexual Roulette  
  
From Finland  
To New Orleans  
You wouldn't believe  
What I've seen  
People jump my train  
They jump my scene  
And it's all  
For a plate of beans  
Food  
  
Been looking high  
Been looking low  
What gotta know is  
How low can you go  
I'm not a picky eater  
You know what i mean  
I like to lick  
My plate clean  
  
Psychotic women  
They abound  
You wouldn't believe  
The men that I've found  
But I'm not a picky eater  
You know what I mean  
I like to lick  
My plate clean  
  
I know how hard  
It can be to find  
A friend at the end of the day  
If you can count them  
On two hands  
At the end of your life  
Consider yourself lucky  
  
Neurotic, Hispanic, Teutonic food  
  
Bubonic, psychotic, Germanic, blah, etc, food
