##sleep  
(Bergmann)  
album: Sexual Roulette  
  
I came in  
here  
Just looking  
For a friend  
Then I see you  
Surrounded by your  
Sycophants and fans  
You're so good for me  
I'm so good for you  
  
I got in here  
By using your name  
It's too bad  
Now you want to  
Allocate blame  
You're so good for me  
I'm so good for you  
If you're sick of the cocaine  
And driving around  
Until it's all gone  
If you're rick of the guys  
Who are so good at sex  
They can't even come anymore  
I borrowed some money  
If you want to leave  
I don't want to make you  
  
Uh-uh  
I don't wanna  
Make you  
  
Let's go to sleep
