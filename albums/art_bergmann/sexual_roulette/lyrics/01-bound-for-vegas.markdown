<br />
Load up the trucks<br />
Don't forget the make-up<br />
We've got the six semis<br />
For the money<br />
None for the show<br />
We've got our costumes ready<br />
Got to go go go<br />
<br />
Bound for Vegas<br />
Bound for Vegas<br />
<br />
Who's got the map<br />
Who's gonna navigate<br />
We've got six shows<br />
On the strip<br />
It's a sellout<br />
Wayne Newton doesn't<br />
Want us to be late<br />
<br />
It's in my heart<br />
I'm making a financial start<br />
<br />
They call me the performer<br />
I guess they always will<br />
Call me the entertainer<br />
Don't retire me yet<br />
I ain't over the hill<br />
I ain't had my fill<br />
<br />
It's in my heart<br />
I'm making a financial start<br />
I'm a never was<br />
Trying to be a has-been<br />
A has-been on the come-back trail<br />
Come-back to me<br />
On the Vegas scene<br />
By the age of fifty<br />
<br />
Good-bye Vancouver, Good-bye Toronto<br />
Good-bye New York<br />
Even the St. Louis blues<br />
I said buy Detroit, buy New York<br />
Ain't going Route 66<br />
Give me I-85<br />
<br />
Bound for Vegas<br />
Bound for Vegas<br />
<br />
It's a sellout
