##bar of pain  
(Bergmann/Susann Richter)  
album: Sexual Roulette  
  
You're just a fly  
hanging up on the wall  
In the bar of pain  
Waiting on my last call  
  
There's damage in your eye  
There's damage in your smile  
Reflections in my golden drink  
Reflections in your golden eye  
  
Bar of pain  
Not again  
  
I put my trust in you  
I put my trust in your  
I love you crazy  
But please don't steal my stereo  
  
I let you in my house  
I let you in my house  
Steal around steal everything  
Like a cheesy mouse  
  
You shove me  
Into the breach  
Now you're hanging on  
Like a bloody leach  
You shove me  
Into the breach  
Jesus, what a vision  
Within reach  
  
Bar of pain  
Not again  
  
I put my trust in you  
I put my trust in you  
Looking and looking  
Into each others eyes  
Just a couple of flies  
On a lowly cowpie
