<i>album: Sexual Roulette</i><br />
<br />
You're just a fly<br />
hanging up on the wall<br />
In the bar of pain<br />
Waiting on my last call<br />
<br />
There's damage in your eye<br />
There's damage in your smile<br />
Reflections in my golden drink<br />
Reflections in your golden eye<br />
<br />
Bar of pain<br />
Not again<br />
<br />
I put my trust in you<br />
I put my trust in your<br />
I love you crazy<br />
But please don't steal my stereo<br />
<br />
I let you in my house<br />
I let you in my house<br />
Steal around steal everything<br />
Like a cheesy mouse<br />
<br />
You shove me<br />
Into the breach<br />
Now you're hanging on<br />
Like a bloody leach<br />
You shove me<br />
Into the breach<br />
Jesus, what a vision<br />
Within reach<br />
<br />
Bar of pain<br />
Not again<br />
<br />
I put my trust in you<br />
I put my trust in you<br />
Looking and looking<br />
Into each others eyes<br />
Just a couple of flies<br />
On a lowly cowpie</span>
