##hospital song  
(Bergmann)  
albums: Sexual Roulette + Design Flaw  
  
Yes I know  
What I've done  
And I know  
That it's wrong  
Cuz I talked  
To your mom  
We watched you  
All night long  
I put a pillow  
Under your head  
Laid down some rags  
You'd read  
Friends sent cards  
And flowers  
Said they hoped  
You got well  
  
From your hospital bed  
To my padded cell  
There's not one thing  
We need  
This is heaven and hell  
  
Maybe later  
We'll get together  
Learn how to relax  
Maybe later  
We'll get together  
And have a relapse  
  
I watch you sleep  
In your tubes  
And IV's  
They kept your face  
So clean  
Would it seem  
Too mean  
If I pull the plug  
On your dream machine  
Would I be  
Losing you  
Or would we  
Meet again  
  
How I wish  
You knew  
How to live  
How I wish  
We'd known  
How to live
