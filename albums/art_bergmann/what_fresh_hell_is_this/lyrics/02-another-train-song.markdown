##another train song  
(Bergmann)  
album: What Fresh Hell Is This?  
  
I saw you at the station  
Waving and smiling bye-bye  
No, I&rsquo;ve never seen you so happy  
With a ticket in your hand  
On a train to the east  
  
No, don&rsquo;t ever let me go  
Don&rsquo;t let them make me say  
I told you so baby  
Baby, baby, don&rsquo;t get in line  
Now look who&rsquo;s crying  
  
I saw you on the platform  
Waving and smiling and looking so fine  
Your parents are so well informed  
You follow suit  
The blind leading the blind  
  
No, don&rsquo;t ever let me go  
Don&rsquo;t let them make me say  
I told you so baby  
Baby, baby, don&rsquo;t get in line  
Now look who&rsquo;s crying  
That&rsquo;s the whole of the law  
Bye-bye  
  
Your parents gave you orders  
Cursed with a birth certificate  
A passport and a stamp  
You&rsquo;re on a train crossing borders  
Machine gun nest   
Barbed wire blessed   
Holiday camp  
  
No, don&rsquo;t ever let me go  
Don&rsquo;t let them make me say  
I told you so baby  
Baby, baby, don&rsquo;t get in line  
Now look who&rsquo;s crying  
That&rsquo;s the whole of the law  
Bye-bye   
That&rsquo;s the whole of the law  
Bye-bye
