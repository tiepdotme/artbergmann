(Bergmann/Chris Wardman)  
album: What Fresh Hell Is This?  
  
I&rsquo;ll pollute the world for you  
Do anything you want me to  
And I&rsquo;ll salute your flag - as I do  
I do all this and enjoy it too  
  
I&rsquo;ll be a real fine drag for you  
Create a heap of slag for you  
Mess up your girls &ndash; like you do  
I hang naked in full public view  
  
We got a contract, contract  
Who&rsquo;s schmoozing who  
  
Yeah, I dig my own grave for you  
Be a total slave for you  
Go around the world for you  
Create a monster &ndash; and bring it too  
  
We got a contract, contract  
Who&rsquo;s using who  
Contract, contract  
Who&rsquo;s screwing who  
Contract, contract  
Who&rsquo;s schmoozing who  
C-O-N-T-R-A-C-T  
I got my CEO salary  
What I got  
C-O-N-T-R-A-C-T  
I screw my home and family  
What you want  
  
C-O-N-T-R-A-C-T  
S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y  
Let&rsquo;s get together  
And have some drinks and discuss it  
Aw, heck, here&rsquo;s a piece of my neck  
F-R-I-C-T-I-O-N  
Friction, friction  
  
I be a total drag for you  
Create a heap of slag for you  
Mess up your girls &ndash; like you do  
I create a monster &ndash; and eat it too  
  
We got a contract, contract  
Who&rsquo;s using who  
Contract, contract  
Who&rsquo;s screwing who  
We got a contract, contract  
Who&rsquo;s using who  
Contract, contract  
Who&rsquo;s screwing who  
Contract, contract  
  
Congratulations
