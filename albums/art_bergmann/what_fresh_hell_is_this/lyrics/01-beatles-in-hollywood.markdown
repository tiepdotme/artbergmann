&nbsp;<i>album: What Fresh Hell Is This?</i><br />
<br />
There are no absolutes to human misery<br />
Things can get worse<br />
Hum...humming in the wires<br />
No news is good news<br />
Sad children of the fates<br />
These homeless of the world<br />
All gathered here in this bar for a while<br />
To forestall going out in the world<br />
Yeah, I think of a million things<br />
As I ride through the night<br />
My dead dad above me<br />
I&rsquo;m down the well<br />
If this is hell<br />
Turn up the heat<br />
If you&rsquo;re the devil<br />
Turn up the god-damned heat<br />
<br />
You&rsquo;re a running, baby deer<br />
Caught in the headlights<br />
Have you ever really faced fear<br />
Like a butterfly in drying concrete<br />
Laying in the gutter facing the wrong way<br />
And the stars aren&rsquo;t here anymore<br />
If I ever get off of this bed<br />
I&rsquo;ll believe in you<br />
<br />
I just wanted to be good<br />
Like the Beatles in Hollywood (repeat)<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;m so sick of cake<br />
I&rsquo;m sick of health<br />
A drunken rage<br />
Hey, I can do that straight<br />
Logically I could reason my way<br />
Right back to hell<br />
I could medicate myself<br />
Right back into a coma<br />
Religiously<br />
I kick my habit<br />
Indulgently<br />
<br />
All the doctors in the town<br />
The nurses in the institution<br />
All the philosophers in the world<br />
All the priests in the suburbs<br />
Couldn&rsquo;t tell me why<br />
Why the woman hurt<br />
If they only had a clue<br />
They convince you that<br />
There&rsquo;s no such thing as luck<br />
Til you&rsquo;re so fucked up<br />
You need a lawyer to become unstuck<br />
<br />
I just wanted to be good<br />
Like the Beatles in Hollywood (repeat)<br />
<br />
Don&rsquo;t ask me<br />
I&rsquo;ve nothing to say<br />
Nobody cares about anybody else anyway<br />
<br />

Don&rsquo;t ask me<br />
I&rsquo;ve nothing to say<br />
Nobody cares about anybody else anyway...</span><br />
<span style="color: #c0c0c0"><br />
I will not be another<br />
This is nameless drivel<br />
From this faceless void<br />
I will put my name on a tombstone<br />
And plant it in a quiet corner somewhere<br />
<br />
I just wanted to be good<br />
Like the Beatles in Hollywood (repeat)<br />
