<br />
When you wake up every morning<br />
Just to face one more deadline<br />
Will you think back on me<br />
And admit you were the same kind<br />
When you stop all your denying<br />
That somewhere inside you<br />
There&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s like me too<br />
Who does the things I do <br />
When you finally make up your mind<br />
To stay for more than just one night<br />
Will we find out <br />
What you&rsquo;re really like<br />
Isn&rsquo;t that like me<br />
To lie, thieve, cheat, and steal<br />
For you isn&rsquo;t that like you<br />
To come around and say<br />
I owe you<br />
Will you still love me<br />
When I&rsquo;m nearer my god to thee<br />
Will you still love me<br />
When I&rsquo;m nearer my got to thee<br />
When you&rsquo;ve made<br />
All your arrangements<br />
To get out of your house<br />
And how to smash your plates and china<br />
To disavow your vows<br />
Smash your sacred cow<br />
Give me a nod of approval<br />
Show me a little sign<br />
That will make me stronger for you<br />
Knowing you&rsquo;ve made up your mind<br />
Isn&rsquo;t that like me<br />
To lie, thieve, cheat, and steal for you<br />
Isn&rsquo;t that like you<br />
To come around and say<br />
I owe you<br />
Will you still love me<br />
When I&rsquo;m nearer my god to thee<br />
Will you still love me<br />
When I&rsquo;m nearer my god to thee<br />
When you finally make up your mind<br />
To stay for more than just one night<br />
We&rsquo;re gonna find out <br />
What we&rsquo;re really like<br />
Will you still love me<br />
When I&rsquo;m nearer my god to thee<br />
Will you still love me<br />
When I&rsquo;m nearer my god to thee<br />
