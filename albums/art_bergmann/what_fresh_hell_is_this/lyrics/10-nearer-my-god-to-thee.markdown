##nearer my god to thee  
(Bergmann)  
album: What Fresh Hell Is This?  
  
When you wake up every morning  
Just to face one more deadline  
Will you think back on me  
And admit you were the same kind  
When you stop all your denying  
That somewhere inside you  
There&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s like me too  
Who does the things I do  
When you finally make up your mind  
To stay for more than just one night  
Will we find out  
What you&rsquo;re really like  
Isn&rsquo;t that like me  
To lie, thieve, cheat, and steal  
For you isn&rsquo;t that like you  
To come around and say  
I owe you  
Will you still love me  
When I&rsquo;m nearer my god to thee  
Will you still love me  
When I&rsquo;m nearer my got to thee  
When you&rsquo;ve made  
All your arrangements  
To get out of your house  
And how to smash your plates and china  
To disavow your vows  
Smash your sacred cow  
Give me a nod of approval  
Show me a little sign  
That will make me stronger for you  
Knowing you&rsquo;ve made up your mind  
Isn&rsquo;t that like me  
To lie, thieve, cheat, and steal for you  
Isn&rsquo;t that like you  
To come around and say  
I owe you  
Will you still love me  
When I&rsquo;m nearer my god to thee  
Will you still love me  
When I&rsquo;m nearer my god to thee  
When you finally make up your mind  
To stay for more than just one night  
We&rsquo;re gonna find out  
What we&rsquo;re really like  
Will you still love me  
When I&rsquo;m nearer my god to thee  
Will you still love me  
When I&rsquo;m nearer my god to thee
