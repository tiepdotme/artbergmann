<br />
You got so wired<br />
What did you think<br />
Would happen in the first place<br />
You got so wired<br />
Didn&rsquo;t think<br />
That you would fall from grace<br />
You got so wired<br />
Wasn&rsquo;t it all so calculating<br />
You got so wired<br />
You used to hang on<br />
Every single word I&rsquo;d say<br />
<br />
You&rsquo;ll never break<br />
This demolition heart<br />
You wanna know what it&rsquo;s like<br />
Everything is best kept quiet<br />
And a sordid past takes a poke<br />
At the future<br />
&lsquo;Til the stars fall from the sky<br />
It looks the same<br />
Thrill me or fill me with shame<br />
A sordid past takes a poke<br />
At the future<br />
<br />
The things that are easiest said<br />
Don&rsquo;t impress her<br />
What do we have in common<br />
Stare out the window<br />
And poke fun at all the silly folks<br />
What do we have in common<br />
Chain smoke cigarettes<br />
And sometimes sex<br />
It&rsquo;s something <br />
You can recognize<br />
When you look<br />
Into your lover&rsquo;s eyes<br />
