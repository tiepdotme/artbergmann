##demolished  
(lyrics: Bergmann, music: Bergmann/Dave Genn)  
album: What Fresh Hell Is This?  
  
You got so wired  
What did you think  
Would happen in the first place  
You got so wired  
Didn&rsquo;t think  
That you would fall from grace  
You got so wired  
Wasn&rsquo;t it all so calculating  
You got so wired  
You used to hang on  
Every single word I&rsquo;d say  
  
You&rsquo;ll never break  
This demolition heart  
You wanna know what it&rsquo;s like  
Everything is best kept quiet  
And a sordid past takes a poke  
At the future  
&lsquo;Til the stars fall from the sky  
It looks the same  
Thrill me or fill me with shame  
A sordid past takes a poke  
At the future  
  
The things that are easiest said  
Don&rsquo;t impress her  
What do we have in common  
Stare out the window  
And poke fun at all the silly folks  
What do we have in common  
Chain smoke cigarettes  
And sometimes sex  
It&rsquo;s something  
You can recognize  
When you look  
Into your lover&rsquo;s eyes
