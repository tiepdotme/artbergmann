<i>album: What Fresh Hell Is This?</i><br />
<br />
You turn your friends<br />
Into your clientele<br />
Like a vampire newly-wed<br />
Now you&rsquo;re needing<br />
Some fresh little hell<br />
Because you&rsquo;re all nearly dead<br />
<br />
Knock, knock on my front door<br />
You need my money<br />
And you want me to score<br />
Knock, knock on my front door<br />
Give me more and more and more<br />
And more and more<br />
<br />
All your boys <br />
Are only sixteen years old<br />
You buy them all a car<br />
They deliver and collect<br />
All the gold<br />
They are your rising young stars<br />
<br />
Knock, knock on my front door<br />
You need my money<br />
And you want me to score<br />
Knock, knock on my front door<br />
Give me more and more and more<br />
And more and more<br />
<br />
My city has gone <br />
Look in my eyes<br />
It&rsquo;s a bloodless coup<br />
An Easy-bake take-over<br />
Eastern flower power<br />
<br />
Penthouse apartment<br />
For the money to fill<br />
You know you love the smell<br />
Now there is just one <br />
More or less<br />
Story to tell<br />
And that is how you fell<br />
<br />
Knock, knock on my front door<br />
You need my money<br />
And you want me to score<br />
Knock, knock on my front door<br />
Give me more and more and more<br />
And more and more<br />
<br />
Like a vampire newly-wed<br />
All your brides are nearly dead<br />
Your friends <br />
Hell, yes, your clientele<br />
You take their money<br />
Because you love the smell<br />
Now you&rsquo;re needing <br />
Some fresh little hell<br />
One more down<br />
One less story to tell<br />
One more down<br />
One less story to tell<br />
