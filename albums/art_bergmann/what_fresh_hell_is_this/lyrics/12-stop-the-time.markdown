##stop the time

Start the time  
Every morning  
In the rain  
My life is waiting  
Get on the bus  
Who could enjoy this  
Here on the bus  
Who will employ us  
I take the pains  
To avert my eyes  
There&rsquo;s always a psycho  
With me in his sights  
I wish  
For just 5 minutes  
He&rsquo;d be on my side  
I wish  
For just 5 minutes  
He&rsquo;d be on my side  
Hide behind my paper  
An item in the news  
Some kid  
Got his head blown off  
Now he&rsquo;s twenty-one forever  
A lucky guy  
Twenty-one forever  
He stopped the time  
Count the clocks  
Count the blocks  
Count the stops  
Until I get off  
I wish  
For just 5 minutes  
Stop the time
