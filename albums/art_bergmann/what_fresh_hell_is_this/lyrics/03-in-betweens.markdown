##in betweens

album: What Fresh Hell Is This?  
  
Hey you  
All dressed in black  
In your gravedigger clothes  
Are you down and dirty  
Superclean  
Do you save souls  
  
Be damned or saved  
I don&rsquo;t like in betweens  
Black or white  
I need a girl who&rsquo;s extreme  
  
My tongue goes slack  
I feel a strange affinity  
I start heavy breathing  
In your vicinity  
  
Are you damned or saved  
I don&rsquo;t like in betweens  
Black or white  
I need a girl who&rsquo;s extreme  
  
Are you taking me up  
Taking me down  
Dragging my name  
Through mud all over town  
  
Be damned or saved  
I don&rsquo;t like in betweens  
Black or white  
I need a girl who&rsquo;s extreme  
  
She&rsquo;s a well-rounded girl  
With a happy face  
A renaissance girl  
Or a family disgrace  
Hey you  
All dressed in black  
In your gravedigger clothes  
Are you superclean   
Down and dirty  
Or do you save souls?
