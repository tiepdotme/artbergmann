<br />
<br />
Lead me down your garden path<br />
Show me my innocent past<br />
All the good things<br />
I thought were trash<br />
All the king&rsquo;s horses<br />
All the queen&rsquo;s men<br />
Couldn&rsquo;t put me back together again<br />
Does it take a genius <br />
To understand<br />
<br />
She says don&rsquo;t worry<br />
My whole life&rsquo;s a crime<br />
Roll over me<br />
And I&rsquo;ll bury you alive<br />
<br />
Practising students<br />
Offer up the cure<br />
All the liars talk<br />
That hang around here<br />
It was the longest day<br />
Of the year<br />
In my never-ending search<br />
For culture and bliss<br />
A cup of coffee<br />
And a morning kiss<br />
How could I ever think<br />
There was more than this<br />
<br />
She says so sorry<br />
My whole life&rsquo;s a crime<br />
Roll over me <br />
And I&rsquo;ll bury you alive<br />
<br />
All the king&rsquo;s horses<br />
All the queen&rsquo;s men<br />
Couldn&rsquo;t put me back together again<br />
Does it take a genius <br />
To understand<br />
<br />
She says so sorry<br />
My whole life&rsquo;s a crime<br />
Roll over me<br />
And I&rsquo;ll bury you alive<br />
Don&rsquo;t worry<br />
My whole life&rsquo;s a crime<br />
<br />
Bury you alive<br />
Bury you alive<br />
Take me <br />
Off this earth<br />
For a while&hellip;
