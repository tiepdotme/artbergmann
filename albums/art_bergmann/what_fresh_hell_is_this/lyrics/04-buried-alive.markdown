Lead me down your garden path  
Show me my innocent past  
All the good things  
I thought were trash  
All the king&rsquo;s horses  
All the queen&rsquo;s men  
Couldn&rsquo;t put me back together again  
Does it take a genius  
To understand  
  
She says don&rsquo;t worry  
My whole life&rsquo;s a crime  
Roll over me  
And I&rsquo;ll bury you alive  
  
Practising students  
Offer up the cure  
All the liars talk  
That hang around here  
It was the longest day  
Of the year  
In my never-ending search  
For culture and bliss  
A cup of coffee  
And a morning kiss  
How could I ever think  
There was more than this  
  
She says so sorry  
My whole life&rsquo;s a crime  
Roll over me  
And I&rsquo;ll bury you alive  
  
All the king&rsquo;s horses  
All the queen&rsquo;s men  
Couldn&rsquo;t put me back together again  
Does it take a genius  
To understand  
  
She says so sorry  
My whole life&rsquo;s a crime  
Roll over me  
And I&rsquo;ll bury you alive  
Don&rsquo;t worry  
My whole life&rsquo;s a crime  
  
Bury you alive  
Bury you alive  
Take me  
Off this earth  
For a while&hellip;
