There are no absolutes to human misery  
Things can get worse  
Hum...humming in the wires  
No news is good news  
Sad children of the fates  
These homeless of the world  
All gathered here in this bar for a while  
To forestall going out in the world  
Yeah, I think of a million things  
As I ride through the night  
My dead dad above me  
I&rsquo;m down the well  
If this is hell  
Turn up the heat  
If you&rsquo;re the devil  
Turn up the god-damned heat  
  
You&rsquo;re a running, baby deer  
Caught in the headlights  
Have you ever really faced fear  
Like a butterfly in drying concrete  
Laying in the gutter facing the wrong way  
And the stars aren&rsquo;t here anymore  
If I ever get off of this bed  
I&rsquo;ll believe in you  
  
I just wanted to be good  
Like the Beatles in Hollywood (repeat)  
  
I&rsquo;m so sick of cake  
I&rsquo;m sick of health  
A drunken rage  
Hey, I can do that straight  
Logically I could reason my way  
Right back to hell  
I could medicate myself  
Right back into a coma  
Religiously  
I kick my habit  
Indulgently  
  
All the doctors in the town  
The nurses in the institution  
All the philosophers in the world  
All the priests in the suburbs  
Couldn&rsquo;t tell me why  
Why the woman hurt  
If they only had a clue  
They convince you that  
There&rsquo;s no such thing as luck  
Til you&rsquo;re so fucked up  
You need a lawyer to become unstuck  
  
I just wanted to be good  
Like the Beatles in Hollywood (repeat)  
  
Don&rsquo;t ask me  
I&rsquo;ve nothing to say  
Nobody cares about anybody else anyway  
  
Don&rsquo;t ask me  
I&rsquo;ve nothing to say  
Nobody cares about anybody else anyway...  
  
I will not be another  
This is nameless drivel  
From this faceless void  
I will put my name on a tombstone  
And plant it in a quiet corner somewhere  
  
I just wanted to be good  
Like the Beatles in Hollywood (repeat)
