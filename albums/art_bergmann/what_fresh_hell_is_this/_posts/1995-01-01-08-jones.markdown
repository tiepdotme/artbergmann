She gives me the jones  
Callin&rsquo; all the time  
She&rsquo;s got the phone hooked  
Right into my main-line  
She gives me a loan  
She&rsquo;s a walkin&rsquo; talkin&rsquo;  
Shatterin&rsquo; chatterbox  
Jones  
  
She&rsquo;s got my number  
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; under  
The click of her nails  
Tappin&rsquo; the phone  
It never fails  
It&rsquo;s chills me to the bone  
She puts me back in jail  
And drags me &lsquo;way from home  
  
She&rsquo;s got my number  
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; under  
Jones  
She gives me the jones  
It&rsquo;s in her look  
The blink of an eye  
I&rsquo;m in her book  
Makes me wanna cry  
My goose is cooked  
It makes me wanna die  
She&rsquo;s got my number  
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; under  
Jones  
  
She gives me the jones  
I don&rsquo;t know why  
I can&rsquo;t leave her  
On her own  
Maybe if I knew why  
I could find my way home  
She&rsquo;s got my number  
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; under  
She&rsquo;s got my number  
We&rsquo;ll never slumber  
Jones  
She gives me the jones  
Jones  
She gives me the jones
