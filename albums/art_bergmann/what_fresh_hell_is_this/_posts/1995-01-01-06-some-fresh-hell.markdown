You turn your friends  
Into your clientele  
Like a vampire newly-wed  
Now you&rsquo;re needing  
Some fresh little hell  
Because you&rsquo;re all nearly dead  
  
Knock, knock on my front door  
You need my money  
And you want me to score  
Knock, knock on my front door  
Give me more and more and more  
And more and more  
  
All your boys  
Are only sixteen years old  
You buy them all a car  
They deliver and collect  
All the gold  
They are your rising young stars  
  
Knock, knock on my front door  
You need my money  
And you want me to score  
Knock, knock on my front door  
Give me more and more and more  
And more and more  
  
My city has gone  
Look in my eyes  
It&rsquo;s a bloodless coup  
An Easy-bake take-over  
Eastern flower power  
  
Penthouse apartment  
For the money to fill  
You know you love the smell  
Now there is just one  
More or less  
Story to tell  
And that is how you fell  
  
Knock, knock on my front door  
You need my money  
And you want me to score  
Knock, knock on my front door  
Give me more and more and more  
And more and more  
  
Like a vampire newly-wed  
All your brides are nearly dead  
Your friends  
Hell, yes, your clientele  
You take their money  
Because you love the smell  
Now you&rsquo;re needing  
Some fresh little hell  
One more down  
One less story to tell  
One more down  
One less story to tell
