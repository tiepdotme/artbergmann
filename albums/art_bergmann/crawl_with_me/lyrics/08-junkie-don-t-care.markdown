<br />
Look at that singer<br />
He's been doing this<br />
For years<br />
You little baby<br />
You're so young<br />
You don't show any fear<br />
Look at that singer<br />
Now he's grasping for air<br />
You little baby<br />
You're so young<br />
You're not scared<br />
You don't care<br />
<br />
My baby<br />
She rode in that Lincoln<br />
I hope<br />
She makes it O.K.<br />
My baby<br />
She rode in that Lincoln<br />
I hope<br />
She's alive today<br />
It gets so cold at night<br />
When there's a hint of snow<br />
In the air<br />
Remember<br />
The junkie don't care<br />
<br />
Look at the singer<br />
He's got an oxygen tent<br />
You little baby<br />
Morning came I just went<br />
Look at that singer<br />
Is he your doctor or something<br />
You little junkie<br />
What's the attraction<br />
<br />
You little baby<br />
You're so young<br />
You don't show any fear<br />
You little baby<br />
You're so young<br />
Take a look in the mirror<br />
You little junkie<br />
I see a TV in your eyes<br />
You little junkie<br />
Are you dead or alive<br />
<br />
The junkie don't care<br />
Not as much as<br />
I don't care</span>
