##inside your love  
(Bergmann)  
album: Crawl With Me  
  
You've got your problems  
I've got mine  
They pale in comparison  
To the world outside  
Forty continuous wars  
At any given time  
You want me  
To make up my mind  
  
Consumption was  
Way out of control  
I slammed down hard  
I just had to  
Grab hold  
Nerve ends frayed  
They were over-exposed  
What could I do  
Christ she was beautiful  
  
I could use a piece  
Of resistance  
The glory of a  
Valid incision  
But who has the guts  
To go the distance  
Everybody's paralyzed  
With indecision  
  
I found my own  
Escape route religion  
It was like  
She came from above  
But I spent everything I had  
In another church  
Can I hide myself  
Inside your love  
  
I'm a solemn believer  
In nothing at all  
I wouldn't deceive you  
Until you make me crawl  
I'm a solemn believer  
In nothing at all  
  
Some kind of love  
Is mere obsession  
But my love  
Will be  
A war of attrition  
I'd punch and kick  
And maim and gouge for you  
In fact I'd even  
Kill for you
