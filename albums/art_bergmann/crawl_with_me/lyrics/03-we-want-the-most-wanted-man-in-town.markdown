##(we want) the most wanted man in town  
(Bergmann)  
album: Crawl With Me  
  
I've seen you  
With my friend Jim  
I know  
What you've been doing with him  
You got yourself  
All caught up  
Now you're stuck  
Way out on a limb  
  
Nobody's got the keys  
Especially not me  
Nobody's got the keys  
Especially not me  
  
Not everyone  
Has a pretty face  
Catherine Deneuve  
Has everything on you  
Christie Brinkley  
And her pretty pace  
Her and her husband  
Try to stick it to you  
  
Tonight we're gonna  
Sharpen that knife  
We're gonna carve  
That turkey up right  
It's gonna be  
Such a happy holy day  
When we carve  
Every fear away  
  
We want the most  
Wanted man in town  
When everyone  
Comes down  
  
Not everyone  
Has the means to create  
It depends on your  
Financial situation  
Everyone has the means  
To erase  
It depends on what  
You think of as disgrace  
  
Not everyone comes up  
Smelling like a rose  
Not everyone  
Don't get the dose  
  
We want the most  
Wanted man in town  
When everyone  
Comes down
