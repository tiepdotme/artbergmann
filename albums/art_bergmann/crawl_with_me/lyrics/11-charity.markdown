(Bergmann)  
album: Crawl With Me  
  
All my life  
I always somehow knew  
That power came out of  
The barrel of a gun  
I thought I'd play  
My rock'n'roll  
For a few years  
That's how I would  
Raise my money  
Things didn't pan out  
Like gold from a stream  
But I've got something else  
Right up my sleeve  
I'm going to ship myself  
Overseas  
To cure the world  
Of your disease  
  
Hey Mister  
Lend this kid a dime  
He looks young  
But he's way past his prime  
Hey Mister  
Give these kids some time  
They look good but  
They're living in your slime  
  
I really like you but  
I just can't stand it  
When you ask if  
You can lend a hand  
It's really basically  
A simple plan  
Turn back the tide  
Of the shifting sand  
  
Hey lady  
Come over here  
I want that fur  
And that diamond  
In your ear  
These things you wear  
They won't be enough  
When you're dead  
And getting stuffed  
  
I'm giving you  
A reason to live  
After you give me  
All you can give
