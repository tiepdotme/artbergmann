<i>album: Crawl With Me</i><br />
<br />
All my life<br />
I always somehow knew<br />
That power came out of<br />
The barrel of a gun<br />
I thought I'd play<br />
My rock'n'roll<br />
For a few years<br />
That's how I would<br />
Raise my money<br />
Things didn't pan out<br />
Like gold from a stream<br />
But I've got something else<br />
Right up my sleeve<br />
I'm going to ship myself<br />
Overseas<br />
To cure the world<br />
Of your disease<br />
<br />
Hey Mister<br />
Lend this kid a dime<br />
He looks young<br />
But he's way past his prime<br />
Hey Mister<br />
Give these kids some time<br />
They look good but<br />
They're living in your slime<br />
<br />
I really like you but<br />
I just can't stand it<br />
When you ask if<br />
You can lend a hand<br />
It's really basically<br />
A simple plan<br />
Turn back the tide<br />
Of the shifting sand<br />
<br />
Hey lady<br />
Come over here<br />
I want that fur<br />
And that diamond<br />
In your ear<br />
These things you wear<br />
They won't be enough<br />
When you're dead<br />
And getting stuffed<br />
<br />
I'm giving you<br />
A reason to live<br />
After you give me<br />
All you can give</span>
