<br />
Danny got a mortgage<br />
And sailed it away<br />
His daddy financed him<br />
All the way<br />
Six months<br />
He could've had a boat<br />
Danny<br />
He gave up hope<br />
<br />
He woke up every morning<br />
With the sawing in his head<br />
Thought he'd<br />
Put it down in words<br />
But he<br />
Bit his nails instead<br />
He'd do anything to get rid of the dread<br />
Now Danny<br />
The poor boy is dead<br />
<br />
He was rich<br />
He could have walked<br />
Walked so proud<br />
He dug his ditch<br />
And threw himself in it<br />
When the noise got too loud<br />
<br />
He bought it today<br />
The final cliche<br />
<br />
Danny got a mortgage<br />
And sailed it away<br />
But his daddy<br />
Made him pay pay pay<br />
You and me<br />
Are made of sterner stuff<br />
Danny<br />
Wasn't quite up to snuff<br />
<br />
He woke up every morning<br />
With the sawing in his head<br />
Thoguht he'd<br />
Put it down in words<br />
But he<br />
Bit his nails instead<br />
Six months<br />
He could've had a yacht<br />
We all know<br />
What Danny bought<br />
<br />
He took his car<br />
To the park<br />
Stuck a hose<br />
Fron the exhaust pipe<br />
Through the window<br />
And went to sleep<br />
He sank like a stone<br />
Like the sun<br />
Into the Sea<br />
Permanently<br />
<br />
He bought it today<br />
The final cliche</span>
