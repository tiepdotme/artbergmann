<i>album: Crawl With Me</i><br />
<br />
You've got your problems<br />
I've got mine<br />
They pale in comparison<br />
To the world outside<br />
Forty continuous wars<br />
At any given time<br />
You want me<br />
To make up my mind<br />
<br />
Consumption was<br />
Way out of control<br />
I slammed down hard<br />
I just had to<br />
Grab hold<br />
Nerve ends frayed<br />
They were over-exposed<br />
What could I do<br />
Christ she was beautiful<br />
<br />
I could use a piece<br />
Of resistance<br />
The glory of a<br />
Valid incision<br />
But who has the guts<br />
To go the distance<br />
Everybody's paralyzed<br />
With indecision<br />
<br />
I found my own<br />
Escape route religion<br />
It was like<br />
She came from above<br />
But I spent everything I had<br />
In another church<br />
Can I hide myself<br />
Inside your love<br />
<br />
I'm a solemn believer<br />
In nothing at all<br />
I wouldn't deceive you<br />
Until you make me crawl<br />
I'm a solemn believer<br />
In nothing at all<br />
<br />
Some kind of love<br />
Is mere obsession<br />
But my love<br />
Will be<br />
A war of attrition<br />
I'd punch and kick<br />
And maim and gouge for you<br />
In fact I'd even<br />
Kill for you</span>
