I know<br />
What she wants<br />
But she don't<br />
Get it from me<br />
Opened up and broken<br />
By the age of thirteen<br />
Daddy says<br />
Father knows best<br />
No one else<br />
Needs to know<br />
<br />
Tell me how<br />
You got this sickness<br />
What an age<br />
To be involved with us<br />
There's a little secret<br />
We all share<br />
And I think I get it<br />
When I see you<br />
Laying there<br />
With me in your arms<br />
<br />
She was<br />
Daddy's girl<br />
She must've been<br />
Daddy's girl<br />
<br />
Did a lot of reading<br />
But talked too little<br />
Nietzsche, Sartre, Stendhal<br />
Et al.<br />
Daddy read a lot<br />
But he never<br />
Took us anywhere<br />
Just a room<br />
With a lock<br />
At the top of the stairs<br />
<br />
Tell me how<br />
You got this sickness<br />
What an age<br />
To be involved with us<br />
There's a little secret<br />
We all share<br />
And I think I get it<br />
When I see you<br />
Laying there<br />
With me in your arms<br />
<br />
She was<br />
Daddy's girl<br />
She must've been<br />
Daddy's girl<br />
<br />
Will you come running<br />
When his face falls<br />
Will you come running<br />
When he's giving you<br />
The call<br />
As we walk<br />
Hand in hand<br />
Into our own<br />
Wasteland<br />
<br />
I know<br />
What she wants<br />
But she don't<br />
Get it from me<br />
Opened up and broken<br />
By the age of thirteen<br />
Daddy says<br />
Father knows best<br />
My baby<br />
Let's go upstairs<br />
<br />
Tell me how<br />
You got this sickness<br />
What an age<br />
To be involved with us<br />
There's a little secret<br />
We all share<br />
And I think I get it<br />
When I see you<br />
Laying there<br />
With me in your arms<br />
<br />
She was<br />
Daddy's girl<br />
She must've been<br />
Daddy's girl<br />
