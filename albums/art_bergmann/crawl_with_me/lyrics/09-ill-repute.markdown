##ill repute  
(Bergmann)  
album: Crawl With Me  
  
The minister's lover's husband  
Came home and  
Caught them in the act  
He was not amused  
At their savage lack of tact  
But his wife  
Took him back  
With all his charms  
The premier  
And his cabinet  
Welcomed him back  
With open arms  
  
From the loneliest bedroom  
To the highest office  
In the land  
There's a reputation  
It's all held  
In your powerful hand  
  
You can't wash it away  
How can you help to explain  
You can't wash it away  
  
All it took  
Was a phone call to the east  
Spread around some cash  
Press the flesh and  
Everybody gets financial redress  
It's funny how it works  
One minute you're precious  
The next one you're  
Dirt  
  
From the lowliest bathroom  
To the highest office  
In the land  
There's a reputation  
It's all held  
In your powerful hand  
  
It's something that sticks  
So relax your lips  
We're appalled  
At your unmitigated gall  
Not amused  
At your privilege  
At who you've used  
And abused  
I can't wait  
To vote again  
I'm in a stall  
You're in a tailspin  
I can't wait  
To vote again  
I'm in a stall  
You're in a tailspin now
