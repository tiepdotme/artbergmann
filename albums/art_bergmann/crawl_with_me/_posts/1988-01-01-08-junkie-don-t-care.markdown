Look at that singer  
He's been doing this  
For years  
You little baby  
You're so young  
You don't show any fear  
Look at that singer  
Now he's grasping for air  
You little baby  
You're so young  
You're not scared  
You don't care  
  
My baby  
She rode in that Lincoln  
I hope  
She makes it O.K.  
My baby  
She rode in that Lincoln  
I hope  
She's alive today  
It gets so cold at night  
When there's a hint of snow  
In the air  
Remember  
The junkie don't care  
  
Look at the singer  
He's got an oxygen tent  
You little baby  
Morning came I just went  
Look at that singer  
Is he your doctor or something  
You little junkie  
What's the attraction  
  
You little baby  
You're so young  
You don't show any fear  
You little baby  
You're so young  
Take a look in the mirror  
You little junkie  
I see a TV in your eyes  
You little junkie  
Are you dead or alive  
  
The junkie don't care  
Not as much as  
I don't care
