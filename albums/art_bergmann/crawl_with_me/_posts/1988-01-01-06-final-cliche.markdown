Danny got a mortgage  
And sailed it away  
His daddy financed him  
All the way  
Six months  
He could've had a boat  
Danny  
He gave up hope  
  
He woke up every morning  
With the sawing in his head  
Thought he'd  
Put it down in words  
But he  
Bit his nails instead  
He'd do anything to get rid of the dread  
Now Danny  
The poor boy is dead  
  
He was rich  
He could have walked  
Walked so proud  
He dug his ditch  
And threw himself in it  
When the noise got too loud  
  
He bought it today  
The final cliche  
  
Danny got a mortgage  
And sailed it away  
But his daddy  
Made him pay pay pay  
You and me  
Are made of sterner stuff  
Danny  
Wasn't quite up to snuff  
  
He woke up every morning  
With the sawing in his head  
Thoguht he'd  
Put it down in words  
But he  
Bit his nails instead  
Six months  
He could've had a yacht  
We all know  
What Danny bought  
  
He took his car  
To the park  
Stuck a hose  
Fron the exhaust pipe  
Through the window  
And went to sleep  
He sank like a stone  
Like the sun  
Into the Sea  
Permanently  
  
He bought it today  
The final cliche
