I know  
What she wants  
But she don't  
Get it from me  
Opened up and broken  
By the age of thirteen  
Daddy says  
Father knows best  
No one else  
Needs to know  
  
Tell me how  
You got this sickness  
What an age  
To be involved with us  
There's a little secret  
We all share  
And I think I get it  
When I see you  
Laying there  
With me in your arms  
  
She was  
Daddy's girl  
She must've been  
Daddy's girl  
  
Did a lot of reading  
But talked too little  
Nietzsche, Sartre, Stendhal  
Et al.  
Daddy read a lot  
But he never  
Took us anywhere  
Just a room  
With a lock  
At the top of the stairs  
  
Tell me how  
You got this sickness  
What an age  
To be involved with us  
There's a little secret  
We all share  
And I think I get it  
When I see you  
Laying there  
With me in your arms  
  
She was  
Daddy's girl  
She must've been  
Daddy's girl  
  
Will you come running  
When his face falls  
Will you come running  
When he's giving you  
The call  
As we walk  
Hand in hand  
Into our own  
Wasteland  
  
I know  
What she wants  
But she don't  
Get it from me  
Opened up and broken  
By the age of thirteen  
Daddy says  
Father knows best  
My baby  
Let's go upstairs  
  
Tell me how  
You got this sickness  
What an age  
To be involved with us  
There's a little secret  
We all share  
And I think I get it  
When I see you  
Laying there  
With me in your arms  
  
She was  
Daddy's girl  
She must've been  
Daddy's girl
