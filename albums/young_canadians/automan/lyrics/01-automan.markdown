##automan  
(Bergmann/Jim Bescott)  
Automan 7&quot; + No Escape compilation  
  
Don't wanna be left out  
Thinkin' for myself  
I wanna be part of it all  
My brain on the shelf  
I wanna have a job  
Work for someone else  
  
I will be your automan  
  
Don't wanna be left out  
I wanna be normal  
I wanna wear the same clothes  
As everybody else  
No more second hand  
So you can see what I am  
  
I will be your automan  
I will do anything you want  
  
Shove a quarter in the slot  
And you will understand  
I will be your automan  
  
I wanna sell your product  
Whatever it may be  
I wanna new car  
Like the ones that I see  
I wanna eat right  
Bone dry and squeaky clean  
  
I will be your automan  
  
Don't wanna be left out  
I'll get a good rating  
Ten of fifteen credit cards  
Computerized lady  
A nuclear kitchen  
Robots at the mall  
  
I will be your automan  
I will do anything you want  
  
Shove a quarter in the slot  
You will understand  
I will be your automan  
  
I wanna eat your product  
I want it wall to wall  
Renewable prescriptions  
My Doctor on call  
I wanna be sick  
I wanna relax  
  
I will be your automan  
I will be your automan  
I will be your automan
