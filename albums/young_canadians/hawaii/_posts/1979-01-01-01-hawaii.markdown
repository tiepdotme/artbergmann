Let's go to fuckin' Hawaii  
Get drunk in the sun  
I wanna lay on Waikiki  
Get a tan on my buns  
&nbsp;  
Runnin' from the rain  
Thousands on the run  
Makin' like the rich  
Heading for the fun  
&nbsp;  
Let's go to fuckin' Tahiti  
Lounge on the beach  
Those native girls are so pretty  
Swayin' to the native beats  
&nbsp;  
Runnin' from the rain  
Thousands on the run  
Makin' like the rich  
Heading for the fun  
&nbsp;  
2 AM  
Economy Air  
747  
Drunk to the roof(??)  
Worked all summer  
Saved my money  
So I can warm  
&nbsp;  
Let's go to fuckin' Miami  
Loungin' on the beach  
I got my little Cuban refugee  
Cheaper than a Georgia peach  
&nbsp;  
Runnin' from the rain  
Thousands on the run  
Thinkin' like the rich  
Heading for the fun  
&nbsp;  
Let's go to fuckin' Las Vegas  
Blow a wad in the Sun  
I wanna stop for a party (??)  
Before I'm back under the gun  
&nbsp;  
Runnin' from the rain  
Thousands on the run  
Makin like the rich  
Heading for the fun  
&nbsp;  
2 AM  
Economy Air  
747  
Drunk to the roof (??)  
Worked all summer  
Saved my money  
So I can be warm  
&nbsp;  
Let's go to fuckin' Hawaii  
Let's go to fuckin' Hawaii  
&nbsp;  
Runnin' from the rain  
Thousands on the run  
Makin' like the rich  
Heading for the fun
