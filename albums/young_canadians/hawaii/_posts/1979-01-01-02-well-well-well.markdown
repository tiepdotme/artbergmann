Well, well, well  
I don't have too much to say  
About the people I step over  
On my way to work  
Each and every day  
  
I watch the group up the street  
The great unwashed  
They really bug me  
Yeah, they really bug me  
  
I got a job  
I work in a bank  
Near Hastings and Main  
Cashing cheques for the slaves  
  
And then they walk up the street  
Give their money back to me  
The Bank of BC  
The Bank of BC  
  
Well, I don't care  
I'm just in training  
For a manager's shift  
In the Central Interior  
  
Some sticky little town  
With a Chinese teller (??)  
I think I'm gonna tell her  
All the things I'm gonna tell her
