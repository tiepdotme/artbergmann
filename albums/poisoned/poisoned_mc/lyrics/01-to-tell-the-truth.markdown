##to tell the truth  
(Bergmann)  
cassette: Poisoned  
  
It's four o'clock in the morning  
We're screaming as we stop to a halt on the ice  
I can't move and I'm looking up  
At a big black empty sky  
I've got a personal message  
I want to sent to my own satellite  
From a guy to a girl half way across town  
She might as well be half way around the world  
  
I'm nobody in the middle of nowhere  
Standing on an icy road  
Wondering if anybody's home  
I've got no phone  
But I want you  
If I make it there  
Will anyone be home  
  
I got too much time  
To think about the way we lie (??)  
It takes too much time  
To cover the distance  
Between our lives  
I'm selling myself in Montreal  
She's a high-class whore in Singapore  
I can still see you  
But I want so much more  
  
I'm nobody in the middle of nowhere  
Standing on an icy road  
Wondering if anybody's home  
I've got no phone  
And I want you  
If I make it there  
Will anyone be home  
  
All your friends betrayed you  
And then you come to me (??)  
To tell the truth  
fucking sick (???)  
(???)  
  
Will you live with me (???)  
Without being real  
If I send my love  
Without any dignity  
Will you live with me  
Without being real  
  
I'm nobody in the middle of nowhere  
Standing on an icy road  
Wondering if anybody's home  
I've got no phone  
But I want you  
If I make it there  
Will anyone be home  
  
She's not home
