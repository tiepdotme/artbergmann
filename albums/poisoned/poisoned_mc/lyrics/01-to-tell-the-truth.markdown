<span style="color: #c0c0c0">It's four o'clock in the morning<br />
We're screaming as we stop to a halt on the ice<br />
I can't move and I'm looking up <br />
At a big black empty sky<br />
I've got a personal message<br />
I want to sent to my own satellite<br />
From a guy to a girl half way across town<br />
She might as well be half way around the world<br />
<br />
I'm nobody in the middle of nowhere<br />
Standing on an icy road<br />
Wondering if anybody's home<br />
I've got no phone<br />
But I want you<br />
If I make it there<br />
Will anyone be home<br />
<br />
I got too much time<br />
To think about the way we lie (??)<br />
It takes too much time<br />
To cover the distance<br />
Between our lives<br />
I'm selling myself in Montreal<br />
She's a high-class whore in Singapore<br />
I can still see you<br />
But I want so much more<br />
<br />
I'm nobody in the middle of nowhere<br />
Standing on an icy road<br />
Wondering if anybody's home<br />
I've got no phone<br />
And I want you<br />
If I make it there<br />
Will anyone be home<br />
<br />
All your friends betrayed you<br />
And then you come to me (??)<br />
To tell the truth<br />
fucking sick (???)<br />
(???)<br />
<br />
Will you live with me (???)<br />
Without being real<br />
If I send my love<br />
Without any dignity<br />
Will you live with me<br />
Without being real<br />
<br />
I'm nobody in the middle of nowhere<br />
Standing on an icy road<br />
Wondering if anybody's home<br />
I've got no phone<br />
But I want you<br />
If I make it there<br />
Will anyone be home<br />
<br />
She's not home</span>
