<span style="color: #c0c0c0">What will we talk about today<br />
Or will we just walk in the rain<br />
Why don't we go to your place and wait<br />
<br />
What are you committed to<br />
Maybe lunch and a room for two<br />
Is there something I can buy from you<br />
<br />
Yeah, I guess I got the time<br />
To make a loan<br />
How much interest is there<br />
If I take you home<br />
Yeah, I guess I like you a lot<br />
<br />
What do we believe in<br />
Three squares and a place to live<br />
I'm giving it all I can give<br />
<br />
What would you have me do<br />
Stay here just to get your approval<br />
Maybe I'll supple the booze<br />

<br />
That's what I meant to say<br />
But it always comes out the wrong way<br />
<br />
