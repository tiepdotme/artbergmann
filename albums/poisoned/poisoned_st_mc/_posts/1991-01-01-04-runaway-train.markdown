All I see  
When I try to sleep  
Is you  
Walking away from me  
  
All I offer  
Is on your plate  
I make dinner  
You arrive late  
  
You and I know  
I've got to go  
What about the girl  
I'll never know  
  
The seconds tick by  
Like a runaway train  
The hours go by  
Like a runaway train  
The days go by  
Like a runaway train  
And the years go by  
  
When you leave  
Filled with fright  
I fall apart  
Like shattering light  
  
All I offer  
Is on your plate  
You pick that up  
Throw it in my face  
  
The rain comes down  
Rain  
When it's over  
  
You and I know  
You've got to go  
What about the man  
You'll never know
