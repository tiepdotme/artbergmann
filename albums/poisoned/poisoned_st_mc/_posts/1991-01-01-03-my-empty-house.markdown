Won't you come home  
To my empty house  
I'm all alone  
Except for  
My former spouse  
Won't you come home  
It's full of empty minds  
I've got an empty heart  
Can't you hear the whine  
  
They said  
Things would be alright  
After a couple of years  
Of restraint  
But the kids  
Aren't getting any younger  
And for me  
It's much too late  
  
I got married in a fever  
I'd sonner kill you  
Than leave you  
I'm thinking maybe  
We should have moved  
Staring at you  
Across my living room  
  
When things go wrong  
Turn to the right  
When things get worse  
Pick up a gun  
Things for me  
Just got weird  
I think I shot  
The wrong person  
I'm painting  
The whole house red  
  
Everthing I worked for  
One by one  
Going out my door  
Save for my TV  
Buzzing in the corner  
The house is surrounded  
  
I can get a job  
I can't geed the kids  
I can get a job  
I can't feed you  
If you're as sick of me  
As I am of you  
Believe me  
I feel the same  
  
Won't you come homje  
To my empty house  
I've got an empty heart  
I've got an empty mind  
I went to trade school  
Got my welding ticket  
Did my time  
I've got a 2-car garage  
A lein on my mortgage  
On my happy 2.2  
  
I think I'll paint  
The whole damn town  
Red
