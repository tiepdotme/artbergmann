##yeah, I guess

Yeah, I Guess cassette + Poisoned EP  
  
What will we talk about today  
Or will we just walk in the rain  
Why don't we go to your place and wait  
  
What are you committed to  
Maybe lunch and a room for two  
Is there something I can buy from you  
  
Yeah, I guess I got the time  
To make a loan  
How much interest is there  
If I take you home  
Yeah, I guess I like you a lot  
  
What do we believe in  
Three squares and a place to live  
I'm giving it all I can give  
  
What would you have me do  
Stay here just to get your approval  
Maybe I'll supple the booze  
  
Yeah, I guess I got the time  
To make a loan  
How much interest is there  
If I take you home  
Yeah, I guess I like you a lot  
  
That's what I meant to say  
But it always comes out the wrong way  
  
What would you have me do  
Stay here just to get your approval  
Maybe I'll just supple the booze  
  
I guess I got the time  
To make a loan  
How much interest is there  
If I take you home  
Yeah, I guess I like you a lot
