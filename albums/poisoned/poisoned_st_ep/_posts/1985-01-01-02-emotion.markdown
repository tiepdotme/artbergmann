A woman shrieks  
From the apartment below  
Is it noisy love  
Or a bruise-laying blow  
  
Domestic bliss  
Dirty needle hiss  
Cheap broken street life  
  
Just another fight  
On a social housing row  
The synthesizer swells  
On my radio  
  
Gimme some emotion  
Something I can chew on  
Some honesty and hatred  
Some lustful embraces  
  
Oh what a lovely  
Sounding world  
Hey what a lovely   
Sounding world  
  
Incoming news   
From a foreign battleground  
No choir of angels  
Sings a soothing sound  
  
Kids die in a crossfire  
Of politics gone mad  
Ideologues   
Dogs shitting led  
  
Mom and dad wait at home  
For a knock on the door  
The synthesizer swells   
On my radio  
  
Gimme some emotion  
Something I can chew on  
Some honesty and hatred  
Some lustful embraces  
  
Down in the street  
Who's getting beat  
For something to eat  
  
Why it's an ugly old man  
Brown bagging it again  
Digging out his lunch  
From a garbage can  
  
His broken bones don't register  
In his broken mind  
He don't need no doctor  
To see his heart  
Beats way out of time  
  
Gimme some emotion  
Something I can chew on  
Some honesty and hatred  
Some lustful embraces
