Some people never go out  
I understand why  
Need something to read about  
The space in their eyes  
  
Others we just can't stay in  
No romance no matter how stricken  
Though poverty is not what it seems  
I can't fathom fear  
  
So if I seem close to danger  
What does the bible say  
Nothing will ever change  
Safe in our beds  
Like the rich in their tombs  
  
Guns and heroin  
Guns and heroin  
  
Where did the money come from  
Two weeks out of prison  
Fifty dollars for a gun  
Turned into fifty thousand  
  
We met two mutual friends  
She's a hooker I'm a musician  
He wants legitimate business  
God if he only knew it's the same as...  
  
Guns and heroin  
Guns and heroin  
  
Tell me what is your reason  
for entering our fair state  
What is your purpose  
of crossing the border here today  
What is your business  
in this beautiful country  
What are your reasons  
for entering the USA  
  
Guns and heroin  
Guns and heroin
