I used to work with someone  
Me and Billy always got the job done  
I thought this would last for years  
The start of a promising career  
All this was ruined at an early age  
By distortion on the public page  
Cuz I met this guy at a party one night  
Don't know what I said  
Didn't know he could write  
He said &quot;I've got some dirt on you&quot;  
All he wanted from me was the facts  
The next day I read we were through  
You know it said I stuck a knife in your back  
  
I'll forget what you said  
If you forget what I heard  
If you forget what you read  
I'll remember the word  
  
I used to go with a girl  
We're gonna go around the world  
She said love  
You know the one  
Forever gonna be so much fun  
I should have known this could never last  
Now she's just a photograph  
Cuz I met this chck at a party one night  
Don't know what I said  
Didn't know she could write  
She said &quot;I've got some dirt on you&quot;  
All she wanted was the facts  
Next day I read we were through  
Read that we were through  
You know it said I stuck a knife in your back  
Sticking knives in our backs  
Yellow journalist  
When I see you again  
We'll act like friends  
And carry on  
With the social pretense  
  
Chorus  
  
I want you  
But all we see  
Are the jaundiced little notes  
Of the blind  
Can you hear me  
Through the din  
And hope that nothing's lost in the translation  
Every town's got a whore  
And think they've got a saint  
And if the two should ever meet  
Who's gonna lodge the complaint  
  
Chorus
