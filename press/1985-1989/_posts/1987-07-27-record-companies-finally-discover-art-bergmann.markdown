Well well well. Art Bergmann finally seems to be getting the record company attention he deserves. Manager Sam Feldman reports Art's latest demo tape has piqued interest in a whole slew of labels - Polygram, Capitol, Enigma, CBS and Duke Street - with the bulk of the interested parties from the New York and Los Angeles wings of said companies.  
  
Feldman "doesn't think there will be a problem" getting a contract with a label - a couple are in the process of drawing up contracts - and that he's looking for a deal where the label will go "the long route" with everyone's favorite local underground sensation.
