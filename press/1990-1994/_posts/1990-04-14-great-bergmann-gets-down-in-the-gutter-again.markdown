ART BERGMANN

Sexual Roulette (Duke Street)

4 out of four stars

Now, this is more like it. Art turns up the grunge on his second platter for Duke Street, howling like a wild beast and scorching on the gee-tar.

Lyrically, he's down in the gutter again, detailing the sordid affairs of murderous junkies, sexual deviates and general on-(or over)-the-edge lunatics.

The Zeppelinesque Dirge # 1 is truly disturbing, while the Hospital Song will have one and all singing along to the irresistably poppy chorus, "maybe later, we'll get together and have a relapse."

And there are several more killers to choose from, including the hard-hitting Gambol, the lovely (and warped) ballad Sleep, and the rollicking Bound For Vegas. Exceptional.
