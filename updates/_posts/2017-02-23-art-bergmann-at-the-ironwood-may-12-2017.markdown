Iconoclastic singer-songwriter, legendary figure in the Canadian punk rock alternative music scene since the late 70’s plays the Rickshaw Friday May 19th.

In his 40 plus years of making music Art has fronted pioneering bands The K-tels, Young Canadians, Los Popularos and Poisoned as well as releasing Juno winning albums under his own name.
 Art garnered a Juno Award nomination for Most Promising Male Vocalist in 1989. James O'Mara and Kate Ryan were nominated for Best Music Video for Bergmann's "Our Little Secret". Art's 1995 album "What Fresh Hell Is This?" won the Juno Award for Best Alternative Rock Album in 1996. Art's 2016 album "The Apostate” received a nomination to the Polaris Music Prize Long List.

On May 12, Weewerk Recordings will re-release his 1991 self-titled album as Remember Her Name, the lead song from the original album.
