"The Apostate" is Art Bergmann's first full length of new material since the Juno winning "What Fresh Hell Is This" and is the follow up to his well-received 2014 ep release "Songs For The Underclass". Mesmerizing and masterful, "The Apostate" displays a rejuvenated singer songwriter who at the top of his lyrical game, has pushed his sound significantly, creating some of his most dynamic songs ever recorded.<!--more-->More country and eastern folk flavored then previous albums, Art is forging new ground and claiming his forthright place amongst his contemporaries, while continuing to re-establish his brilliant and eclectic past body of work. The atmosphere featured on this release is at times moody and desperate, but in the best possible way. The use of discordant sounds and instruments nontraditional to cliché rock music helps to create a vast soundscape of impressive scope. It is true art, beyond classification, and evidence of a growth in Art's song writing, musicianship as well as performance.

Nominated for the Polaris Music Prize [long list](http://polarismusicprize.ca/2016-nominees/){:target="_blank"} in 2016.

#### Press Quotes:

> "The Apostate distils sources of information, music and culture Bergmann has been steeping himself in since he moved to Airdrie. It includes a fascination with desert and prairie music, from Tuareg blues in Africa to the windswept Americana of alt-country bands like Wilco." – Vancouver Sun

> "This is a magnificent album. Both Underclass and The Apostate showcase Art Bergmann's songwriting gifts. More than ever, his songs are poignant, biting, and powerful. These recent works show a fantastic polish and patina -- if there's grit, it's there for a reason. That may be the biggest difference between this and his earlier works. While his talent hasn't changed, Bergmann has improved his crafting to levels unattainable by most." – Huffington Post

> "Long lauded as one of the original punk influences of the ‘70s, and an equally mark-making figure in alternative rock in the ‘80s and early ‘90s, Bergmann's current album The Apostate draws from all that and more, in crafting his best-yet collection of songs – and first full-length recording in 18 years. It says a lot about an artist's persistence and integrity when his prime work is done at age 63; Bergmann is happy about that, as are critics, and the Polaris Music Prize large jury, who long-listed The Apostate in 2016." – Socan Magazine
