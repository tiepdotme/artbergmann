In 1991, Art Bergmann released his third solo record, a self-titled collection of songs that snarled and soothed, and marked a personal turning point in the singer-songwriterâ€™s life. Now, 26 years later, Bergmann revisits this personal landmark of an album, remastered and re-titled as "Remember Her Name".
